# systematic-search-wos-scopus
This repository contains notebooks and data for the short presentation "Systematic search on Web of Science and Scopus", given in November 2019. It takes place in the preparation of the 6th Assessment Report of IPCC Group III and introduces the basics of creating a search equation, exporting the associated results from Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus and merging all the results into a single database. The search and visualization of the years of projection and distribution of the country studies are finally given. 
This tutorial is intended for beginners in Python but the functions are not studied in detail and it may be necessary to search more explanation on the documentation of the libraries used. Furthermore, to carry out searches on WoS and Scopus, it is necessary to have institutional identifiers because their databases are not openaccess.
