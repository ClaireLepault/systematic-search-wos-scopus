Successful implementation of this mitigation practice requires knowledge of the role of species identity and diversity on carbon accrual of plantations. Despite this need, solid data on the long-term development of forest plantations are still very scarce. Monospecific and two species mixture plots of a 77-year-old tree diversity experiment in Yangambi in the Congo basin were fully inventoried. We calculated above-ground C stocks using allometric equations, and soil C stocks by analyzing soil samples at multiple depths. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of taxonomic and functional identity and diversity on the aboveground and soil carbon stocks. A high variability in aboveground C stocks across tree species combinations was observed. Apart from a species identity effect, the proportion of planted species in the total stand basal area (BA(pl)) and effective species richness were identified as compositional parameters with a significant effect on the aboveground carbon (AGC), with BApl being more important. Both AGC and BA(pl) were coupled to the functional identity of the planted species; the planting of short-lived pioneers led to low AGC. We found no clear benefits, but also no drawbacks, for AGC of two species mixture plots over monospecific plots or including nitrogen fixing species in the plantation scheme. However, the latter was the only compositional parameter with a significant positive effect on the soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth. We conclude that the different plantation configurations gave rise to a wide range in carbon stocks. This was predominantly caused by large differences in AGC sequestration over the past 77 years. Altogether, short-lived pioneer species had a low BApl resulting in low carbon sequestration, while partial shade tolerant species achieved the highest AGC stocks. Tolerating spontaneous ingrowth during the plantation development can further increase the AGC stock, given that the appropriate functional type is planted.									3	0	0	3	0	3	0	25	2150-8925			WOS:000364024300027		J	van Zeben, Josephine								Establishing a Governmental Duty of Care for Climate Change Mitigation: Will Urgenda Turn the Tide?

Thus far, there has been very limited success in holding governments or individuals responsible for the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are considered the primary cause of anthropogenic climate change. The recent landmark decision in Urgenda Foundation v. Government of the Netherlands (Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment) breaks with this tradition. In June 2015, the Dutch District Court (The Hague) held that the current climate policies of the government are not sufficiently ambitious for it to fulfil its duty of care towards Dutch society. The judgment, and the accompanying order for the government to adopt stricter GHG reduction policies, raises important questions about the future of climate change liability litigation, the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature, and the effect of litigation on international climate change negotiation and cooperation.									22	0	0	0	0	22	2	6	2047-1025	2047-1033		WOS:000363039300005		J	Cameron, Ross W.

In addition to summer cooling, plants can insulate buildings against heat loss in winter. Research was conducted over two winters using replicated small-scale physical models to simulate heat loss from a built structure and to investigate the insulation properties of plants during cold weather. Brick cuboids were constructed around a water tank maintained at 16 degrees C and energy use monitored. Covering cuboids with ivy (Hedera helix) reduced mean energy consumption by 21% compared to bare cuboids during the first winter (means of 4.3 and 5.4 kWh per week, respectively). During the second winter, when foliage was more extensive a 37% mean saving was achieved (3.7 compared to 5.9 kWh per week). The presence of Hedera enhanced brick temperatures significantly compared to bare walls. Temperature differences were affected by weather parameters, aspect, diurnal time and canopy density. Largest savings in energy due to vegetation were associated with more extreme weather, such as cold temperatures, strong wind or rain. Under such scenarios green facades could increase energy efficiency by 40-50% and enhance wall surface temperatures by 3 degrees C. These empirical studies with replicated treatments augment previous research based on urban modelling and data from non-replicated individual buildings in situ. They indicate that planting design requires more attention to ensure the heat saving aspects associated with green facades and shelter belts are optimised. These aspects are discussed within the context of wider urban ecosystem services provided by vegetation, and implications for climate change mitigation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The global mean concentration of CO2, the most important Greenhouse Gas (GHG), in the atmosphere is now close to 400 ppm. The most comprehensive research efforts concerning safe levels propose that we should strive to keep the atmospheric concentration of CO2 below 350 ppm. This is also a more transparent global goal than using effects in the components of the climate system. Most scenarios show that the combustion of fossil fuels will increase in the future, while the development of renewables is still too marginal to stop this growth. The possibility that countries will leave fossil resources underground does not seem realistic. The only options in the short run to halt emissions of CO2 are the large-scale application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in combination with increased energy efficiency. In the long run, we have to radically transform our societal metabolism towards greater resource efficiency, where renewables can play a more important role. The main barriers for implementation of CCS on a large scale are not technical, but economic and social. As long as the costs for emitting CO2 are much lower than implementing CCS technology, there will not be a market-driven development of CCS. A major challenge for CCS will be to achieve wide public acceptance, since this will also affect the future political attitude to it. This will require an open communication about safety aspects early in the planning phase, where it can be shown that safety issues can be handled, even in the event of major leaks of CO2. To assume a low probability of accidents is not a feasible way forward in the communication process. The future concerning CO2 emissions will be determined very much by actions of the biggest emitters. The developed countries have already emitted a large amount of CO2 and must now take a step forward to show that they are willing to invest in CCS technology. At this stage, it is reasonable to expect developed countries to take a leading role in developing the CCS technology on a large-scale. It is highly probable that developing countries like China will follow this path in the near future, since they have a clear ambition to take a lead in climate change mitigation in the long run and to avoid blame for a deteriorating environment.

However, its high costs mean that uncertainty about the stringency of future climate policy may dissuade firms from investing in this technology. This article explores the relationship between firms expectations of government policy and investment in CCS. First, it synthesizes recent cost estimates for CCS applications in electricity generation and oil sands extraction in Canada. Second, it uses these estimates to investigate the potential impact of policy stringency and uncertainty on CCS adoption in Alberta, a Canadian province with near-ideal CCS potential. The results suggest investment in CCS, and by extension other costly abatement actions, will not occur unless governments create a more stringent and durable climate policy environment than currently exists.Policy relevanceThis paper has two novel and linked objectives, the first of significant utility to researchers and energy modellers in particular, the second to climate policy analysts and decision makers. First, it synthesizes publicly available carbon capture and storage literature and develops cost estimates for key applications related to thermal electricity generation and oil sands extraction in Canada. Second, it uses these cost estimates to investigate the potential impact of policy stringency and uncertainty on carbon capture and storage adoption in Alberta, Canada. Alberta is a test case for CCS due to its fossil resources and high CO2 storage potential, and the technology's success or failure in this jurisdiction should be of interest to policy makers elsewhere.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	23	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000359350700002		J	Komendantova, Nadejda; Vocciante, Marco; Battaglini, Antonella				Vocciante, Marco/U-9156-2019	Vocciante, Marco/0000-0002-6824-4488			Can the BestGrid Process Improve Stakeholder Involvement in Electricity Transmission Projects?								ENERGIES				8	9			9407	9433		10.3390/en8099407				SEP 2015	2015	The European Union has set ambitious targets for deployment of renewable energy sources to reach goals of climate change mitigation and energy security policies. However, the current state of electricity transmission infrastructure is a major bottleneck for further scaling up of renewable energy in the EU. Several thousands of kilometers of new lines have to be constructed and upgraded to accommodate growing volumes of intermittent renewable electricity. In many countries, construction of electricity transmission projects has been delayed for several years due to concerns of local stakeholders. The innovative BESTGRID approach, reported here, brings together transmission system operators (TSOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to discuss and understand the nature of stakeholder concerns. This paper has three objectives: (1) to understand stakeholder concerns about the deployment of electricity transmission grids in four pilot projects according to five guiding principles: need, transparency, engagement, environment, and impacts on human health as well as benefits; (2) to understand how these principles can be addressed to provide a basis for better decision-making outcomes; and (3) to evaluate the BESTGRID process based on feedback received from stakeholders and the level of participation achieved according to the ladder of Arnstein. This paper goes beyond a discussion of measures to mitigate opposition to understand how dialogue between TSOs and the publicrepresented mainly by NGOs and policy-makersmight lead to a better decision-making process and more sustainable electricity transmission infrastructure deployment.									10	0	0	1	0	10	0	7	1996-1073			WOS:000362553000021		J	Bernardes, Luis; Carneiro, Julio; Madureira, Pedro; Brandao, Filipe; Roque, Cristina				Roque, Cristina/A-8146-2013; Carneiro, Julio F/B-6348-2016	Roque, Cristina/0000-0002-2583-594X; Carneiro, Julio F/0000-0002-4900-3355; Madureira, Pedro Miguel/0000-0003-4762-6273			Determination of Priority Study Areas for Coupling CO2 Storage and CH4 Gas Hydrates Recovery in the Portuguese Offshore Area								ENERGIES				8	9			10276	10292		10.3390/en80910276				SEP 2015	2015	Gas hydrates in sub-seabed sediments is an unexploited source of energy with estimated reserves larger than those of conventional oil. One of the methods for recovering methane from gas hydrates involves injection of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), causing the dissociation of methane and storing CO2. The occurrence of gas hydrates offshore Portugal is well known associated to mud volcanoes in the Gulf of Cadiz. This article presents a determination of the areas with conditions for the formation of biogenic gas hydrates in Portugal's mainland geological continental margin and assesses their overlap with CO2 hydrates stability zones defined in previous studies. The gas hydrates stability areas are defined using a transfer function recently published by other authors and takes into account the sedimentation rate, the particulate organic carbon content and the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone. An equilibrium equation for gas hydrates, function of temperature and pressure, was adjusted using non-linear regression and the maximum stability zone thickness was found to be 798 m. The gas hydrates inventory was conducted in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and a full compaction scenario was adopted, with localized vertical flow assumed in the accrecionary wedge where mud volcanoes occur. Four areas where temperature and pressure conditions may exist for formation of gas hydrates were defined at an average of 60 km from Portugal's mainland coastline. Two of those areas coincide with CO2 hydrates stability areas previously defined and should be the subject of further research to evaluate the occurrence of gas hydrate and the possibility of its recovery coupled with CO2 storage in sub-seabed sediments.									2	0	0	0	0	2	3	13		1996-1073		WOS:000362553000065		J	Lute, Michelle L.; Attari, Shahzeen Z.; Sherman, Steven J.								Don't rush to flush								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				43				105	111		10.1016/j.jenvp.2015.06.003				SEP 2015	2015	Encouraging sustainable water use is a critical endeavor in addressing issues associated with short- and long-term droughts. Toilets account for up to 26.7% of indoor household water use. Therefore substantial opportunity exists to conserve water via reduced flushing after urination at home. Here, we use an online survey (N = 1008) to identify barriers to reduced flushing. The majority of participants reported they always flush (63%) and believed that others should always flush. Social norms surrounding cleanliness are the most prevalent reasons for flushing. Results suggest four main barriers to reducing flushing: disgust sensitivity, habitual nature of flushing, norms regarding cleanliness, and lack of pro-environmental motivations. Participants who always flush are less likely to sacrifice for the environment than occasional flushers. Participants tended to underestimate average American water use and their own water use. Targeted interventions to decrease urine-related disgust and increase pro-environmental motivations may help achieve water conservation goals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				265				187	195		10.1016/j.amc.2015.05.005				AUG 15 2015	2015	The climate change is an example of the biggest social dilemma in the human history. Climate change mitigation can be successful only if the whole world will undertake an internationally coordinated collective action. Costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases can be easily calculated for each individual, but benefits of the successful reduction will be distributed among all the "players", independently from theft actual contributions to sustainable development. Evolutionary games provide a suitable theoretical framework for studying the challenges of climate change, and we will build on this fact in the present paper to study the evolution of cooperation and discuss its implications for offsetting the temptations to pollute. It has namely become painfully clear that tackling the climate change will be costly, and accordingly, the temptations to pollute will always be present. Can the element of unpredictability that is inherently present in social interactions and the environment increase the probability of adopting the cleaner strategy? We employ the spatial prisoner's dilemma game where the cooperative behaviour is challenged by defection that promises individuals a higher fitness and is thus more likely to prevail. Obtained results are contrasted with real data and indicators of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Innovative policy tools are needed to address the adverse health effects of climate change. Cash transfers are established policy tools for protecting population health before, during and after climate-related disasters. For example, the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Programme provides cash transfers to reduce food insecurity resulting from droughts. We propose extending cash transfer interventions to more proactive measures to improve health in the context of climate change. We identify promising cash transfer schemes that could be used to prevent the adverse health consequences of climatic hazards. Cash transfers for using emission-free, active modes of transport e.g. cash for cycling to work could prevent future adverse health consequences by contributing to climate change mitigation and, at the same time, improving current population health. Another example is cash transfers provided to communities that decide to move to areas in which their lives and health are not threatened by climatic disasters. More research on such interventions is needed to ensure that they are effective, ethical, equitable and cost effective.									5	0	0	2	0	5	1	18	0042-9686	1564-0604		WOS:000359966400013	26478613	J	Michelozzi, Paola; Lapucci, Enrica; Farchi, Sara				Michelozzi, Paola/J-8608-2016; Lapucci, Enrica/K-4907-2018	Michelozzi, Paola/0000-0002-1646-2555; Lapucci, Enrica/0000-0002-8951-1901			[Meat consumption reduction policies: benefits for climate change mitigation and health].

Recenti progressi in medicina				106	8			354	7		10.1701/1960.21296				2015-Aug	2015	Agricultural food production substantially contributes to green house gas (GHG) emissions worldwide and 80% of the agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector, in particular from ruminants. Meat consumption is generally above dietary recommendations in many countries, including Italy, and it is increasing in developing countries. Although meat is a source of essential nutrients, it provides large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk factor for obesity and for several diseases such as stroke, breast cancer and colon cancer. Dietary changes, with lower intake of red and processed meat, are likely to be beneficial for improving health and for the environment by reducing emissions of GHG. Data on meat consumption in Italy among adults, referred to the last ten years, shows heterogeneity among regions, with the highest consumption in the North-western regions and generally with higher consumption among males. We describe meat consumption distribution worldwide, in Europe and Italy. An assessment of the potential environmental and health co-benefits considering different reduction scenarios of red meat consumption in Italy is provided. Dietary changes can substantially lower GHG and coordinated actions are needed across public health and other sectors to promote healthy, low-emission diets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5		2038-1840		MEDLINE:26228857	26228857	J	Anaker, Anna; Nilsson, Maria; Holmner, Asa; Elf, Marie								Nurses' perceptions of climate and environmental issues: a qualitative study								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING				71	8			1883	1891		10.1111/jan.12655				AUG 2015	2015	AimThe aim of this study was to explore nurses' perceptions of climate and environmental issues and examine how nurses perceive their role in contributing to the process of sustainable development.BackgroundClimate change and its implications for human health represent an increasingly important issue for the healthcare sector. According to the International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics, nurses have a responsibility to be involved and support climate change mitigation and adaptation to protect human health.DesignThis is a descriptive, explorative qualitative study.MethodsNurses (n=18) were recruited from hospitals, primary care and emergency medical services; eight participated in semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews and 10 participated in two focus groups. Data were collected from April-October 2013 in Sweden; interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis.ResultsTwo main themes were identified from the interviews: (i) an incongruence between climate and environmental issues and nurses' daily work; and (ii) public health work is regarded as a health co-benefit of climate change mitigation. While being green is not the primary task in a lifesaving, hectic and economically challenging context, nurses' perceived their profession as entailing responsibility, opportunities and a sense of individual commitment to influence the environment in a positive direction.ConclusionsThis study argues there is a need for increased awareness of issues and methods that are crucial for the healthcare sector to respond to climate change. Efforts to develop interventions should explore how nurses should be able to contribute to the healthcare sector's preparedness for and contributions to sustainable development.									18	0	0	0	0	18	1	19	0309-2402	1365-2648		WOS:000357885800013	25810044	J	Howden-Chapman, Philippa Lynne; Keall, Michael; Conlon, Fiona; Chapman, Ralph					Chapman, Ralph/0000-0002-3437-8525			Urban interventions: understanding health co-benefits								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING				168	4			196	203	1400049	10.1680/udap.14.00049				AUG 2015	2015	Improving aspects of the built environment, such as retrofitting housing and designing transport options that encourage active journeys (cycling and walking), can have significant and demonstrable impacts on health and well-being. Policies that have primary goals such as improving energy efficiency can have important measureable co-benefits for health and well-being, as well as climate change mitigation. The authors carried out two community housing trials to measure the benefits of installing insulation and effective heating on households' health and wellbeing. These trials have shown that these energy efficiency projects increase health and well-being, reduce hospitalisations and excess winter mortality, and at the same time reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In a third trial, they remediated injury hazards in houses, significantly reducing the household injury rate. Using a quasiexperimental study, the authors evaluated the impact of retrofitting infrastructure to increase cycling and walking. This showed that the distance from housing to the new infrastructure was an important explanatory factor for positive changes in choice of modes of travel. Distance of housing from school was also an important factor in whether children walked or cycled to school. In conclusion, retrofitting urban and suburban infrastructure can increase health and well-being, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.									2	0	0	0	0	2	2	6	1755-0793	1755-0807		WOS:000215444200006		J	Bilgen, Selcuk; Keles, Sedat; Sarikaya, Ikbal; Kaygusuz, Kamil				keles, sedat/J-3601-2017	keles, sedat/0000-0003-3293-5241			A perspective for potential and technology of bioenergy in Turkey: Present case and future view								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				48				228	239		10.1016/j.rser.2015.03.096				AUG 2015	2015	Biomass easily can replace fossil fuels in the use of modern biomass energy due to the environmental benefits and the renewable. Biomass energy in Turkey is one of the most important renewable energy sources in terms of energy potential. Traditional biomass (wood and dung) in Turkey has a significant energy production rate. This ratio has been decreased with the decline of forests and the reduction seen in animal husbandry, recently. Traditional biomass is usually used in the form of non-commercial fuel and meets a quarter of the domestic energy production. Traditional biomass energy production has been planned 7530 Btep in 2020. In Turkey, the use of modern biomass energy is important in terms of the country's economy, and the environment pollution. Turkey has the potential to provide an alternative source of energy from the most appropriate and most cost-effective agricultural products according to its ecological conditions. Modern biomass started with 17 Btep in 2000. However, there has not been the foresight to future production. Whereas traditional biomass energy production should increasingly be reduced and modern biomass energy production should be increased. This situation will offer new investment fields to investors. This study shows that biomass energy continues to be the main source of energy for climate change mitigation and energy sustainability in Turkey, particularly in its traditional forms.

For this expansion mountainous areas are regarded as specifically suitable because of their high-energy potential. However, mountains also are biodiversity hot-spots and provide scenic landscapes and therefore offer high natural and cultural value. Preserving this natural and cultural value whilst intensifying RE, is expected to increase land use conflicts. This is of great concern in particular for vulnerable areas such as the Alps. Reconciling RE expansion with the preservation of natural and cultural values and thus minimizing environmental impacts represents one of the most important challenges now. For this a systematic assessment of the wide range of impacts is needed. This literature review scrutinizes RE resources which are relevant in the Alpine region and their effects on the environment by applying the Ecosystem Service approach. Thereby, we identified possible environmental constraints when exploiting Alpine RE potentials and generated recommendations for future strategies on expanding RE. The outcomes highlight the strong need for interdisciplinary research on RE and environmental conflicts. Interdisciplinary approaches such as the concept of Ecosystem Services can help to cover the wide range of aspects associated with these particular human-environment interrelations.

It can be tested through various methods. The identification and detailed analysis of specific types of ICT solutions, case studies approach or scenarios analysis are examples of perspectives for impact assessment that can lead to the proof that successful applications of ICT solutions entails optimised, more accessible, less resource consuming and less emission intensive transport. The impact of ICTs in travel induction and substitution and resulting decarbonisation effect is difficult to assess isolated from other social, economic and technologic drivers. Financial applicability reflects initial investment cost as well as operation maintenance costs. Organizational feasibility refers primarily to the necessary changes in organisation and conduct of operations created by introduction of ICTs. The social factor results from user and public acceptance or lack of it. User acceptance is combination of many sub factors of which most important are: D2D travel time, D2D travel costs, comfort and convenience, safety and security. The objective of the article is to present the applicability of ICT solutions in passenger transport from the perspective of transport users taking into consideration real case studies from different European background. These case studies were identified as a result of specific selection process in order to receive a complex and differentiated sample. The first element of the selection process was the identification of ICT solutions to be applied in case studies. The next element was the choice of regions corresponding to varied economic and geographic characteristics. In addition, cultural factors have a strong impact on the behaviour of users. The resulting multidimensional factor matrix allows for the selection of best fitting case studies, which have potential to cover most of the ICT applications. Five European settings are selected for in-depth research. Each case represents different geographic, social and economic area, which forms a good European sample across differentiated setups. Case studies are supported by user surveys. Surveys allow for direct answers regarding user attitudes towards proposed ICTs. Based on this approach findings could be reported. The main conclusion is that users in various regions with very different characteristics as to the wealth, GDP levels, geography, and cultural back-grounds represent surprisingly similar attitudes towards ICTs. Specific findings regarding different types of solutions and different type of users are presented in the article. The analysis of selected case studies shows also that they could offer solution to many of transport sector problems including key issues from transport policy agenda: environment, mobility or accessibility. The paper is based on the authors research conducted within COMPASS project (Optimised co-modal passenger transport for reducing carbon emissions, project co-funded by the European Commission within the Seventh Framework Programme).									5	0	0	0	0	5	0	22	1648-4142	1648-3480		WOS:000362223600016		J	Caritte, Victor; Acha, Salvador; Shah, Nilay				; Shah, Nilay/E-4925-2015	Acha, Dr Salvador/0000-0002-9363-9481; Shah, Nilay/0000-0002-8906-6844			Enhancing Corporate Environmental Performance Through Reporting and Roadmaps								BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				24	5			289	308		10.1002/bse.1818				JUL 2015	2015	Managing the carbon footprint of companies and addressing their respective decarbonization plans is a challenging endeavour. The aim of this study is to help companies better understand the issues around decarbonization and environmental performance by suggesting a holistic management process on which they could embark. This process comprises two crucial steps, which are (a) sustainability reporting and (b) low-carbon roadmaps. These steps are covered and further developed based on a detailed study of the UK food retail sector. This sector is relevant due to its economic and environmental importance, but most importantly it has a significant record of available environmental reports in the public domain and a large potential to influence consumers, policy makers and multiple supply chains. Sustainability reporting is assessed by analysing environmental KPIs disclosed in corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, and then these are compared against industry standards. This analysis highlights a general lack of consistency and transparency in CSR reporting of UK food retailers. Consequently, a low-carbon roadmap based on relevant KPIs and on the backcasting' framework is presented as a case study in order to showcase how a hypothetical UK food retailer can employ a low-carbon roadmap. The case study demonstrates that ambitious environmental targets are achievable if robust corporate action plans are followed. Furthermore, the case study indicates that capital might be misallocated in favour of highly visible environmental stores and on-site energy generation technologies, whilst more could be done by applying energy efficiency measures that have the potential to deliver substantial carbon savings.

In the pursuit of low-carbon energy and climate change mitigation, hydropower is experiencing a new renaissance. At the forefront of this renaissance are Chinese actors as the world's largest hydropower dam-builders. This paper aims to discuss the role of South-South technology transfer of low-carbon energy innovation and its opportunities and barriers by using a case study of the first large Chinese-funded and Chinese-built dam in Cambodia. Using the Kamchay Dam as an example, the paper finds that technology transfer can only be fully successful when host governments and organizations have the capacity to absorb new technologies. The paper also finds that technology transfer in the dam sector needs to go beyond hardware and focus more on the transfer of expertise, skills and knowledge to enable long-term sustainable development.

A macroeconomic-climate evaluation of Sweden's CO2 emissions								APPLIED ENERGY				148				196	209		10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.03.029				JUN 15 2015	2015	This paper provides a production and consumption-based empirical macroeconomic-climate assessment of Sweden's CO2 emissions. The core methodology is based on three complementary quantitative methods, namely energy-economy-environment indicators, econometric analyses, and a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) sectoral model. Based on the latest available data (1971-2011), indicators show a sharp decarbonisation of Sweden's energy supply mix pre-1990, and reductions or reversals in energy intensity, CO2 intensity and energy use post-1990. Reductions in energy intensity are mostly attributed to substantial increases in economic activity rather than reductions in energy use. Econometric results show that variability of CO2 emissions is best explained by CO2 intensity than any other tested variable. The MRIO model shows that the Swedish emissions trading balance is negative with both the European Union and the rest of the world (i.e. embodied CO2 emissions in imports are higher than embodied emissions in exports). Sweden's low-carbon intensity is a critical and horizontal explanatory factor in our results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After the adoption of the 1988 constitution, large tracts of Indigenous lands have been recognized, which now cover more than 21% of the Brazilian Amazon. Well conserved for the most part, they play a key role in deterring deforestation and in climate change mitigation, while also undergoing drastic economic and social changes. There are many factors challenging the sustainability of Indigenous territories today, including the deficient enforcement of Indigenous rights. The injunction that Indigenous peoples should protect the environment is complicating the definition of which economic activities they are entitled to develop inside their territories. The focus of this paper is to review the current situation of Indigenous territories in the Brazilian Amazon, providing historical context and pointing out current challenges and the debates surrounding their sustainability.									10	0	0	5	1	11	2	22	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000366330500026		J	Thurston, George; Lippmann, Morton								Ambient Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Cardiopulmonary Diseases								SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE				36	3			422	432		10.1055/s-0035-1549455				JUN 2015	2015	Population exposures to ambient outdoor particulate matter (PM) air pollution have been assessed to represent a major burden on global health. Ambient PM is a diverse class of air pollution, with characteristics and health implications that can vary depending on a host of factors, including a particle's original source of emission or formation. The penetration of inhaled particles into the thorax is dependent on their deposition in the upper respiratory tract during inspiration, which varies with particle size, flow rate and tidal volume, and in vivo airway dimensions. All of these factors can be quite variable from person to person, depending on age, transient illness, cigarette smoke and other short-term toxicant exposures that cause transient bronchoconstriction, and occupational history associated with loss Of lung function or cumulative injury. The adverse effects of inhaled PM can result from both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposures to PM, and can range from relatively minor, such as increased symptoms, to very severe effects, including increased risk of premature mortality and decreased life expectancy from long-term exposure. Control of the most toxic PM components can therefore provide major health benefits, and can help guide the selection of the most human health optimal air quality control and climate change mitigation policy measures. As Such, a continued improvement in our understanding of the nature and types of PM that are most dangerous to health, and the mechanism(s) of their respective health effects, is an important public health goal.									9	0	0	6	0	9	3	55	1069-3424	1098-9048		WOS:000355362100010	26024349	J	He Jian-Kun								Objectives and strategies for energy revolution in the context of tackling climate change								ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH				6	2	SI		101	107		10.1016/j.accre.2015.08.005				JUN 2015	2015	Global climate change mitigation and CO2 emission reduction have promoted the revolutionary transformation in energy system. The core content of energy system revolutionary transformation is to replace the high-carbon energy system dominated by fossil energy with low-carbon energy system dominated by new and renewable energy and finally realize the near-zero emission of CO2. The new energy system transformation has also led to a reform in global economic and social development patterns. Developing low-carbon economy becomes the fundamental strategy of sustainable development under climate risk management and the only solution to getting on the road from industrial civilization to ecological civilization. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Guided by the targets, China directs its economy development to a low-carbon pattern. Therefore, new and renewable power capacity need to reach 1300 GW, and the electricity generated should be 4 times of that in 2013 with a continuous increase rate of 6%-8% around 2030. The pace of energy substitution need to be accelerated and efficient, safe, clean, and low-carbon energy supply and consumption systems should be established besides strengthened energy conservation and improved energy efficient. Therefore, reform need be deepened, favorable policy system and market mechanism for energy revolution and low-carbon development need be established, energy pricing mechanism should be reformed, and national carbon market should be formed to provide a favorable policy and market environment for low-carbon technology innovation and industry development.									4	1	0	0	0	4	2	7	1674-9278			WOS:000434535400004		J	Jiao Nian-Zhi; Chen Da-Ke; Luo Yong-Ming; Huang Xiao-Ping; Zhang Rui; Zhang Hai-Bo; Jiang Zhi-Jian; Zhang Fei								Climate change and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems and countermeasures in China								ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH				6	2	SI		118	125		10.1016/j.accre.2015.09.010				JUN 2015	2015	The ecosystems of China seas and coasts are undergoing rapid changes under the strong influences of both global climate change and anthropogenic activities. To understand the scope of these changes and the mechanisms behind them is of paramount importance for the sustainable development of China, and for the establishment of national policies on environment protection and climate change mitigation. Here we provide a brief review of the impacts of global climate change and human activities on the oceans in general, and on the ecosystems of China seas and coasts in particular. More importantly, we discuss the challenges we are facing and propose several research foci for China seas/coasts ecosystem studies, including long-term time series observations on multiple scales, facilities for simulation study, blue carbon, coastal ecological security, prediction of ecosystem evolution and ecosystem-based management. We also establish a link to the Future Earth program from the perspectives of two newly formed national alliances, the China Future Ocean Alliance and the Pan-China Ocean Carbon Alliance.									11	2	0	8	0	12	1	7	1674-9278			WOS:000434535400006		J	Alhorr, Yousef; Elsarrag, Esam								Climate Change Mitigation through Energy Benchmarking in the GCC Green Buildings Codes								BUILDINGS				5	2			700	714		10.3390/buildings5020700				JUN 2015	2015	It is well known that the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) of countries resides at or close to the top of the global table of CO2 emissions per capita and its economy relies heavily on its fossil fuels. This provides a context for green building programs that initially aim to create an understanding of emission pathways within the GCC and hence develop approaches to their reduction in the built environment. A set of criteria will allow specific analysis to be undertaken linked to the spatial dimensions of the sector under study. In this paper, approaches to modelling energy consumption and CO2 emissions are presented. As investment in the built environment continues, natural resources dwindle and the cost of energy increases, delivering low-energy buildings will become mandatory. In this study, a hybrid modelling approach (bottom-top & top-bottom) is presented. Energy benchmarks are developed for different buildings' uses and compared with international standards. The main goals are to establish design benchmarks and develop a modelling tool that contains specific information for all buildings types (existing and new), as well as planned and projected growths within the various city districts, then integrate this database within a geospatial information system that will allow us to answer a range of "what-if"-type questions about various intervention strategies, emissions savings, and acceptability of pre-defined course of actions in the city sector under consideration. The spatial carbon intensity may be adjusted over a certain period, (e.g., through local generation (microgeneration)) or due to an increasing proportion of lower carbon-energy in the generation mix and this can be related to the sector and city overall consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7	2075-5309			WOS:000215241700020		J	Kibue, Grace Wanjiru; Pan, Genxing; Zheng, Jufeng; Li Zhengdong; Mao, Li								Assessment of climate change awareness and agronomic practices in an agricultural region of Henan Province, China								ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY				17	3			379	391		10.1007/s10668-014-9546-5				JUN 2015	2015	Agricultural production is a complex interaction between human and natural environment, making agriculture both significantly responsible and vulnerable to climate change. China, whose socioeconomy is fundamentally dependent on agriculture, is already experiencing climate-change-related issues that threaten food security and sustainable development. Climate change mitigation and adaptation are of great concern to ensure food security for the growing population and improve the livelihoods of poor smallholder producers. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Henan Province, China to assess agronomic practices of smallholder farmers, adaptation strategies and how climate change awareness and perceptions influence the farmers' choice of agronomic practices. The results showed that the vast majority of farmers owned < 10 Chinese Mu (0.7 ha) and nearly all farmers' relied on intensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase yield at the detriment of environment. However, farmers who were aware of climate change had adopted agronomic practices that reduce impacts of climate change. Information about climate change, lack of incentives, lack of credit facilities and small farm sizes were major hindrance to adaptation and adoption of farming practices that can reduce impacts of climate change. This study recommends that research findings should be disseminated to farmers in timely and appropriate ways. The central government should formulate policies to include subsidies and incentives for farmers to motivate adoption of eco-friendly agronomic practices.									4	0	0	1	0	4	1	39	1387-585X	1573-2975		WOS:000354481200001		J	Suter, Matthias; Connolly, John; Finn, John A.; Loges, Ralf; Kirwan, Laura; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa; Luescher, Andreas				Sebastia, M.

Such challenges were addressed in a continental-scale field experiment conducted over 3years, in which the amount of total nitrogen yield (N-tot) and the gain of N yield in mixtures as compared to grass monocultures (N-gainmix) was quantified from four-species grass-legume stands with greatly varying legume proportions. Stands consisted of monocultures and mixtures of two N-2-fixing legumes and two nonfixing grasses. The amount of N-tot of mixtures was significantly greater (P0.05) than that of grass monocultures at the majority of evaluated sites in all 3years. N-tot and thus N-gainmix increased with increasing legume proportion up to one-third of legumes. With higher legume percentages, N-tot and N-gainmix did not continue to increase. Thus, across sites and years, mixtures with one-third proportion of legumes attained similar to 95% of the maximum N-tot acquired by any stand and had 57% higher N-tot than grass monocultures. Realized legume proportion in stands and the relative N gain in mixture (N-gainmix/N-tot in mixture) were most severely impaired by minimum site temperature (R=0.70, P=0.003 for legume proportion; R=0.64, P=0.010 for N-gainmix/N-tot in mixture). Nevertheless, the relative N gain in mixture was not correlated to site productivity (P=0.500), suggesting that, within climatic restrictions, balanced grass-legume mixtures can benefit from comparable relative gains in N yield across largely differing productivity levels. We conclude that the use of grass-legume mixtures can substantially contribute to resource-efficient agricultural grassland systems over a wide range of productivity levels, implying important savings in N fertilizers and thus greenhouse gas emissions and a considerable potential for climate change mitigation.									39	1	0	34	0	40	1	99	1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000353977500027	25626994	J	Busari, Mutiu Abolanle; Kukal, Surinder Singh; Kaur, Amanpreet; Bhatt, Rajan; Dulazi, Ashura Ally				Bhatt, Rajan/J-7180-2019; Busari, Mutiu/L-1961-2019; Cerda, Artemi/I-4670-2013	Cerda, Artemi/0000-0001-5326-4489			Conservation tillage impacts on soil, crop and the environment								INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH				3	2			119	129		10.1016/j.iswcr.2015.05.002				JUN 2015	2015	There is an urgent need to match food production with increasing world population through identification of sustainable land management strategies. However, the struggle to achieve food security should he carried out keeping in mind the soil where the crops are grown and the environment in which the living things survive. Conservation agriculture (CA), practising agriculture in such a way so as to cause minimum damage to the environment, is being advocated at a large scale world-wide. Conservation tillage, the most important aspect of CA, is thought to take care of the soil health, plant growth and the environment. This paper aims to review the work done on conservation tillage in different agro-ecological regions so as to understand its impact from the perspectives of the soil, the crop and the environment. Research reports have identified several benefits of conservation tillage over conventional tillage (CT) with respect to soil physical, chemical and biological properties as well as crop yields. Not less than 25% of the greenhouse gas effluxes to the atmosphere are attributed to agriculture. Processes of climate change mitigation and adaptation found zero tillage (ZT) to be the most environmental friendly among different tillage techniques. Therefore, conservation tillage involving ZT and minimum tillage which has potential to break the surface compact zone in soil with reduced soil disturbance offers to lead to a better soil environment and crop yield with minimal impact on the environtnent.

With the minerals industry venturing into riskier locations, new mining projects need to deliver both strong sustainability benefits while meeting the necessary technical and financial requirements. Improved approaches to recycling, resources conservation, energy and water efficiency, greenhouse gas reduction, biodiversity, local enterprise development, and community development programs all meet the aims of good sustainability practice and require innovative techniques to move away from the 'business as usual' paradigm. This paper outlines the recent developments on the SUSOP sustainability opportunities and risks framework, which utilises the Five Capitals sustainability model, to provide a holistic approach for delivering enhanced environmental, social and community outcomes into mining and minerals projects. Case studies where this framework has been applied are discussed and the key emerging themes such as the benefits of better engagement with local stakeholders, the value from creation of local enterprises, and misperceptions of costs related to sustainability outcomes are highlighted.

Although deforestation is severe in the Ethiopian highlands, some remnants of dry afromontane forests still exist. However, the resilience of these forests under climate change scenarios is unknown. Therefore, we studied (1) the extent and spatial patterns of standing dead stems along an elevational gradient and (2) the effects of dieback on forest carbon sequestration potential and aboveground carbon stocks, in Juniperus procera and Olea europaea dominated dry afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, using allometric models combined with tree ring analysis. Juniperus procera and Olea europaea constitute 67% of the total tree population. Tree dieback affected a quarter of the total population. This loss is critical because 92.2% of snags belong to J. procera and O. europaea, which are the foundation species of the study forest. The total estimated mean aboveground C-stock was 19.3 (+/- 3.9) Mg C ha(-1). Of this estimate, snags contributed 34.5% of total C-stock. The estimated annual C-sequestration potential of the study forest was 0.33 (+/- 0.03) Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), which is 27% less when compared to the pre-tree dieback C-sequestration potential. We found a decreasing trend in tree dieback with increasing elevation, which implies that the aboveground C-stocks and climate change mitigation potentials of the forest, was highly affected at lower elevations which is the drier part of the landscape. Tree ring analysis showed that trees reach medium-sized stem diameter (i.e., 20-25 cm) after no less than 100 years, indicating that the effect of forest dieback on C-sequestration potential and ecosystem function is long-lasting. Our results provide information on the magnitude of tree dieback and its long-lasting impact on forest carbon fluxes and forest ecosystem services. Evidently, the results substantiate the importance of protecting such forest to maintain the quality of the environment and to reduce efforts and cost for forest restoration after major loss. Finally, the information gained by this study provides baseline information for comparison of future carbon sequestration estimates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), a forest-based climate change mitigation instrument, the manner in which equity' is understood will be of critical importance for the impacts and acceptance of REDD+policies and initiatives. Whereas the concept has been extensively studied in the academic literature, references to equity in REDD+policy debates and documents are often vague, leaving room for various interpretations and modes of implementation. In our case study of the Tanzanian national REDD+policy domain, we provide a conceptual framework based on an institutional logics approach for analysing the various underlying rationalities in the equity in REDD+' debate. We apply it to demonstrate how the involved policy actors draw from heterogeneous equity logics in their support for and opposition to different governance models, highlighting the importance of precise contextualization and operationalization of broad international principles in national REDD+initiatives.

Corporate culture is measured with the instrument developed by Cameron and Quinn (2006). The instrument measures corporate culture in terms of four categories: clan culture, adhocracy culture, hierarchy culture, and market culture. The results indicate that adhocracy culture has statistically significant positive relationships with the management system, product development, and climate change mitigation aspects of environmental management or sustainability management. Excessive hierarchy culture has a negative relationship with the overall score of environmental management. An appropriate combination of hierarchy culture and adhocracy culture enhances the overall score.

Based on survey data from two European convenience samples (N = 616/309) we found that public endorsements of mitigation and adaptation are strongly associated: Someone who is willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) is also willing to prepare for climate change impacts (adaptation). Moreover, people endorsed the two response strategies for similar reasons: People who believe that climate change is real and dangerous, who have positive attitudes about protecting the environment and the climate, and who perceive climate change as a risk, are willing to respond to climate change. Furthermore, distinguishing between (spatially) proximal and distant risk perceptions suggested that the idea of portraying climate change as a proximal (i.e., local) threat might indeed be effective in promoting personal actions. However, to gain endorsement of broader societal initiatives such as policy support, it seems advisable to turn to the distant risks of climate change. The notion that "localising" climate change might not be the panacea for engaging people in this domain is discussed in regard to previous theory and research.									15	0	0	2	0	15	0	24	1932-6203			WOS:000353711600106	25922938	J	Roman-Figueroa, Celian; Paneque, Manuel				Paneque, Manuel/A-6930-2015	Paneque, Manuel/0000-0002-8731-0233; Roman-Figueroa, Celian/0000-0001-6237-7805			Ethics and Biofuel Production in Chile								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS				28	2			293	312		10.1007/s10806-015-9535-1				APR 2015	2015	Chile needs to diversify its energy supply, and should establish policies that encourage the production and use of biofuels. The demand for energy resources increases with population growth and industrial development, making it urgent to find green alternatives to minimize the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of traditional fuels. However, it is required that sophisticated strategies consider all externalities from the production of biofuels and should be established on the basis of protecting the environment, reducing GHG emissions and to avoid violating human rights. This article presents the Chilean reality, based on ethical principles that should be guarded to regulate the bioenergy market. These principles are: (1) human rights, (2) environmental sustainability, (3) climate change mitigation, (4) right to a fair reward, and (5) equitable distribution. It is concluded that in Chile the concentration of land and water for the development of extractive industries; and for agricultural and forestry purposes, contradicts the principle of human rights. The unequal distribution of income is also highlighted as part of a cycle of social injustice, with a high Gini coefficient (0.52). However, the policy of biofuels can be strengthened with the early use of second generation feedstock, the introduction of fair trade and regulation by the state to encourage participation of small farmers, and allows a position for Chile at the forefront of bioenergy production.									8	0	0	0	0	8	0	63	1187-7863	1573-322X		WOS:000352209100006		J	Hernandez, Rebecca R.; Hoffacker, Madison K.; Field, Christopher B.								Efficient use of land to meet sustainable energy needs								NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE				5	4			353	358		10.1038/nclimate2556				APR 2015	2015	The deployment of renewable energy systems, such as solar energy, to achieve universal access to electricity, heat and transportation, and to mitigate climate change is arguably the most exigent challenge facing humans today(1-4). However, the goal of rapidly developing solar energy systems is complicated by land and environmental constraints, increasing uncertainty about the future of the global energy landscape(5-7). Here, we test the hypothesis that land, energy and environmental compatibility can be achieved with small-and utility-scale solar energy within existing developed areas in the state of California (USA), a global solar energy hotspot. We found that the quantity of accessible energy potentially produced from photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) within the built environment ('compatible') exceeds current statewide demand. We identify additional sites beyond the built environment ('potentially compatible') that further augment this potential. Areas for small-and utility-scale solar energy development within the built environment comprise 11,000-15,000 and 6,000 TWh yr(-1) of PV and CSP generation-based potential, respectively, and could meet the state of California's energy consumptive demand three to five times over. Solar energy within the built environment may be an overlooked opportunity for meeting sustainable energy needs in places with land and environmental constraints.									30	0	0	8	1	30	2	58	1758-678X	1758-6798		WOS:000351842100020		J	Anderson, John E.; Wulfhorst, Gebhard; Lang, Werner								Energy analysis of the built environment-A review and outlook								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				44				149	158		10.1016/j.rser.2014.12.027				APR 2015	2015	The built environment is responsible for significant use of final energy (62%) and is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions (55%). Achieving environmental goals, including climate change mitigation, requires comprehensive methodologies to accurately assess the impacts from this sector. Research to date focuses on either individual buildings or on the urban level (e.g., metropolitan regions). Robust and accurate methodologies have been developed to quantify environmental impacts at both scales. While methodologies overlap between the building and urban levels, assessment remains largely confined within each scale. At the building level, research focuses on materials, architectural design, operational systems, structural systems, construction, and analysis methods. At the urban scale, urban form, density, transportation, infrastructure, consumption, and analysis methods are the main research focuses. The paper presents the major findings at each scale. The work then argues for an expanded analysis framework to account for the interplay between the building and city level captured through a new impact category: induced impacts. This new framework is necessary to address actual patterns of construction (new buildings or retrofits within existing cities) and to quantify currently missing impacts. Based on the findings, a new methodology to capture induced impacts in the built environment is outlined. Finally, practical and policy implications are discussed. Inclusion of induced impacts is critical to achieve environmental objectives within the building sector and beyond. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IN INDIAN NORTH-WESTERN HIMALAYAS								GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL				17	1	SI		50	60						MAR 2015	2015	The technology transfer for rural livelihood development had greater impact to protect microclimatic conditions which further affects the microflora and microbial activities to larger extent in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The technological interventions were made by the Himalayan Research Group organization which helped in economic upliftment of rural poor, women empowerment and in environment protection in hill region. The major activities are Passive Solar Retrofitting (namely, Thermosyphoning Air heat Panel (TAP), Trombe Wall (TW), and Sun Spaces (SS)) fodder development, vermicompost biotechnology, button mushroom cultivation and protected cultivation for climate change mitigation and adaptations. The solar retrofits reduced estimated 4.97 tones carbon emission per household during six winter months which helped in reducing the fuel wood consumption. Improved varieties of different fodder spp. were introduced for year round green fodder availability and reduce soil erosion and reduction in tree lopping. Fodder choppers and silage preparation was popularized to contain the fodder wastage. Vermicompost biotechnology was popularized among farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers for improving the quality of soil. The button mushroom cultivation was used for conversion of agriculture residue into compost making by reducing crop residue burning which increases carbon emission. Protected cultivation in local made polyhouse was popularized to generate maximum returns from small piece of land through cut flower and vegetable cultivation and by raising plant nurseries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	14	1790-7632			WOS:000352254200006		J	Montingelli, M.

Algae-derived biofuels are seen as one of the most promising solutions to mitigate climate change and as alternative to fast depleting of fossil fuels and oil reserves. Microalgae and macroalgae underwent an intense academic and industrial research, thanks to their capability to overcome the drawbacks related to the first and second generations of biomass resources. Major advantages of algae are: no competition with food crops for arable land, high growth rates, low fractions of lignin which reduces the need for energy-intensive pretreatment and compatibility with biorefinery approach implementation. However, some disadvantages such as the presence of high water content, seasonal chemical composition and the occurrence of inhibitory phenomena during anaerobic digestion, make algal biofuels not yet economically feasible although they are more environment friendly than fossil fuels.

In recent years, China has added about 1.7 billion square meters of new floor space in both urban and rural areas on an annual basis. In 2010, the total area of existing buildings in China was approximately 48.6 billion square meters, nearly twice the total of existing buildings areas in the European Union. How to improve energy efficiency in the soaring number of new buildings and accelerate the retrofit of the huge number of existing buildings are two daunting challenges currently facing China in terms of energy security and climate change mitigation at a global level. China has gradually altered the building energy efficiency policy portfolio, from a purely regulatory approach with a mandatory building code at the initial stage to voluntary green buildings initiatives. This paper is structured as a critical assessment of building energy efficiency policies for new and existing buildings. Both strengths and weaknesses of the implemented energy efficiency policies are detailed in each of the studied areas. It also discusses the dilemma of public games in green and sustainable buildings production in the context of Chinese economic development and societal transition. The analysis emphasises the importance of guaranteeing the consistency between policies in the current regulatory framework to maximise the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies in the built environment in China. For this, it is necessary to articulate building energy efficiency policies implementation and broader energy and climate policies. This integrative study provides both a retrospective assessment and prospective direction of building energy efficiency policy development in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it has been suggested that tree species diversity buffers ecosystems against the impacts of disturbances, a relationship known as the "insurance hypothesis". Natural disturbances have increased across Europe in recent decades and climate change is expected to amplify the frequency and severity of disturbance events. In this context, mitigating disturbance impacts and increasing the resilience of forest ecosystems is of growing importance. We have tested how tree species diversity modulates the impact of disturbance on net primary production and the total carbon stored in living biomass for a temperate forest landscape in Central Europe. Using the simulation model iLand to study the effect of different disturbance regimes on landscapes with varying levels of tree species richness, we found that increasing diversity generally reduces the disturbance impact on carbon storage and uptake, but that this effect weakens or even reverses with successional development. Our simulations indicate a clear positive relationship between diversity and resilience, with more diverse systems experiencing lower disturbance-induced variability in their trajectories of ecosystem functioning. We found that positive effects of tree species diversity are mainly driven by an increase in functional diversity and a modulation of traits related to recolonization and resource usage. The results of our study suggest that increasing tree species diversity could mitigate the effects of intensifying disturbance regimes on ecosystem functioning and improve the robustness of forest carbon storage and the role of forests in climate change mitigation.									35	2	0	27	0	37	2	99	0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000350033500001	25526843	J	Wu, Grace C.; Torn, Margaret S.; Williams, James H.

We assessed the operational-phase land-use requirements of different low-carbon scenarios for California in 2050 and found that most scenarios have comparable direct land footprints. While the per MWh footprint of renewable energy (RE) generation is initially higher, that of fossil and nuclear generation increases over time with continued fuel use. We built a spatially explicit model to understand the interactions between resource quality and environmental constraints in a high RE scenario (>70% of total generation). We found that there is sufficient land within California to meet the solar and geothermal targets, but areas with the highest quality wind and solar resources also tend to be those with high conservation value. Development of some land with lower conservation value results in lower average capacity factors, but also provides opportunity for colocation of different generation technologies, which could significantly improve land-use efficiency and reduce permitting, leasing, and transmission infrastructure costs. Basing siting decisions on environmentally-constrained long-term RE build-out requirements produces significantly different results, including better conservation outcomes, than implied by the current piecemeal approach to planning.									6	0	0	1	0	6	0	22	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000349806400005	25541644	J	Remoundou, Kyriaki; Diaz-Simal, Pedro; Koundouri, Phoebe; Rulleau, Benedicte					Rulleau, Benedicte/0000-0002-3659-5769			Valuing climate change mitigation: A choice experiment on a coastal and marine ecosystem								ECOSYSTEM SERVICES				11				87	94		10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.11.003				FEB 2015	2015	This paper adds to a limited literature eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) for mitigation measures against natural hazards caused by climate change, on coastal and marine environments. Our case study is Santander, a coastal region in Northern Spain. The case-study specific natural hazards concern (a) sea-level rise, high tides and extreme wave events that lead to floods and beach erosion, (b) rise in sea temperature that leads to invasive jellyfish blooms and changes in native biodiversity. In particular, we employ a choice experiment (CE) to elicit the value locals place on improvements, through the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, in biodiversity, recreational opportunities and on decreases in health risks associated with jellyfish blooms. Results suggest that people value positively benefits in terms of increased biodiversity and recreation opportunities, as well as health risk reductions, and point to interesting policy implications.

Therefore, sustainability has become a national and international concern, ingrained in many organizational processes. The ability of organizations to respond to sustainability concerns is sometimes hindered by the complexity of integrating sustainability into business models and by the need to rethink their strategic directions. In Romania, sustainable development has become a priority for businesses, but even though companies are showing some concern, there are yet to demonstrate any full commitment (they are mainly concerned with areas such as society and the environment). This paper assesses Romania's involvement in the adoption of actions directed toward the reduction of pollutants and greenhouse gases, namely actions focused on reducing the main causes of pollution. This analysis compares the situation in Romania with that of the European Union. The main concerns can be categorized according to four sectors, which produce the highest quantity of carbon dioxide emissions in the world: the energy sector, the transport sector, the waste sector and the industry sector. The last section of this paper deals with the carbon footprint of Romania and its implications.

It has been industrially feasible for several decades using chemical absorption by alkanolamine solvents. The purpose of this work is to characterize the mass transfer in a spray contactor during CO2 absorption using monoethanolamine as a solvent. A new, effective way to investigate mass transfer is to measure the refractive index during the reactive absorption. Indeed, the concentration and temperature evolution inside the droplet during absorption induces a modification of the refractive index. By using rainbow refractometry technique (GRT), the liquid side mass transfer coefficient was measured in a controlled gas atmosphere during a transfer process in aqueous 30% (w/w) monoethanolamine and compared to the literature.									10	2	0	0	0	11	2	21	0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000348569300029		J	Wicaksana, I.

CHP and tri-generation systems offer high energy conversion efficiency and hence the potential to reduce fuel costs and CO2 emissions. This article serves to provide a state-of-the-art review of fuel cell technology operating in the domestic built environment in CHP and tri-generation system applications. The review aims to carry out an assessment of the following topics: (1) the operational advantages fuel cells offer in CHP and tri-generation system configurations, specifically, compared to conventional combustion-based technologies such as Stirling engines, (2) how decarbonisation, running cost and energy security in the domestic built environment may be addressed through the use of fuel cell technology, and (3) what has been done to date and what needs to be done in the future. The article commences with a review of fuel cell technology, then moves on to examine fuel cell CHP systems operating in the domestic built environment, and finally explores fuel cell tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications. The article concludes with an assessment of the present development of, and future challenges for, domestic fuel cells operating in CHP and trigeneration systems. As fuel cells are an emergent technology the article draws on a breadth of literature, data and experience, mostly from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, America and Australia.Fuel cells are a technology of the future here today, providing a change in the way heat and power are supplied to end users. Fuel cells operating in CHP and tri-generation systems in domestic built environment applications could finally provide the means by which energy generation can transfer from centralised to decentralised locales in a sustainable and effective manner.

Brazil, the fourth largest producer and exporter of swine meat, has an important role to ensure the fulfillment of the goals of food security and climate change mitigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental impact of swine production in Brazil based on life cycle assessment, comparing four manure management systems: liquid manure storage in slurry tanks; the biodigestor by flare; the biodigestor for energy purposes; and composting. Additionally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the uncertainty due to different emissions factors to estimate nitrogen-related emissions from the manure-handling stage. The functional unit considered was 1000 kg of swine carcass in the equalization chamber for cutting or further distribution. The results indicated an environmental profile of swine production in Brazil of 3503.29 kg of CO2 eq. for climate change, 76.13 kg of SO2 eq. for terrestrial acidification, 2.15 kg of P eq. for freshwater eutrophication, 12.33 kg of N eq. for marine eutrophication, 21,521.12 MJ for cumulative energy demand, 1.63 kg of 1.4-DB eq. for terrestrial ecotoxicity, 1706.26 BDP for biodiversity damage potential and 14.99 m(2) for natural land transformation. Feed production had a significant contribution with a range of 17.6-99.5% for all environmental impact categories. Deforestation represented 9.5 and 31.3% of the total impacts for cumulative energy demand and climate change, respectively. Therefore, avoiding the use of grain from deforested areas can significantly decrease the impacts for these impact categories. Regarding the uncertainty analysis, we observed greater variations for terrestrial acidification in slurry tanks, biodigestor by flare and for energy purposes, while for the case of composting, major uncertainties were observed for climate change. For manure management systems, efforts should be made to reduce the emissions of methane in the storage and ammonia in the field application. In this sense, the comparative life cycle assessment indicated that the biodigestor for energy purposes had the best environmental performance for almost all the environmental impacts, mainly due to the biogas capture and the potential of energy saves. Nevertheless, if the goal is to decrease the impacts for terrestrial acidification and marine eutrophication, the slurry tanks is the most preferable scenario compared to all alternative options.

It complements our previous work in [1] which stressed the economic effectiveness and CO2 emission reductions. Based on the results of these two works, here we analyze the trade-offs of the energy-environmental-economic (3E) objectives of the pathways. We find that although CCS technology can help achieve a cost effective and a high degree of CO2 emission abatement, it results in an additional coal consumption and cost disadvantages of RES power. Accordingly, if China heavily relies on CCS technology to achieve power decarbonization, the long-term energy sustainability is undermined. The challenges for policy makers are therefore to design comprehensive packages which are mutually reinforcing or at least compatible with acceptable costs in achieving the 3E objectives for the power decarbonization. With an empirical review of the past policy designs, we also find that China favors energy sustainability, yet neglecting the economic effectiveness and CO2 emissions. The institutional environment including the government's attitudes towards climate change, the development of ETS market and the reforms on electricity price, will largely influence the deployment of low-carbon technologies and thus the pathways of power decarbonization.

Urban downtown areas are densely built busy hubs of life, and are seriously affected by the negative aspects of microclimate as density also equals to higher rate of anthropogenic emissions. When considering the application of energy efficiency measures for buildings, focus should be on the energy efficient refurbishment of the ageing buildings of historical city centres.Is there a relevant common typology for the building stock of historical city centres for the comparable definition of their energy demand? This paper presents a bottom-up methodology to develop and compare a generalized building typology of the urban building stock of European historical downtown areas from different climate zones. The typology is developed with the consideration of the cities' climate data, economical characteristics, furthermore building construction dates and energy consumption patterns; data were collected and compared for Amsterdam, Barcelona and Budapest. Based on the typology the energy demand of the surveyed building types is calculated for each city and energy density of the analysed areas were defined. The study outlines future policy making directions which should address historical building stock. This typology will be the basis for further research for the calculation of energy saving potential of historical city centres of Europe.					2nd International Conference on Energy and Environment - Bringing together Engineering and Economics (ICEE)2nd International Conference on Energy and Environment - Bringing together Engineering and Economics (ICEE)	JUN 18-19, 2015JUN 18-19, 2015	Univ Minho, Sch Engn; Univ Porto, Sch Econ & ManagementUniv Minho, Sch Engn; Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management	Guimaraes, PORTUGALGuimaraes, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2183-3982		978-989-97050-4-3	WOS:000379409300022		B	Lenz, Nela Vlahinic; Rosanda, Andrea; Jakovac, Pavle				Jakovac, Pavle/P-1936-2018	Jakovac, Pavle/0000-0002-0433-824X	Uslu, F		ELECTRICITY SECTOR IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE: CHALLENGES OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION								ADVED 15: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCES								666	674						2015	2015	The analysis of the electricity sector in Southeast Europe shows that hydropower and coal represent the most important energy sources for electricity generation. Hydropower provides a necessary flexibility and storage capacity to help ensure stability of a transmission system and security of supply and supports the integration of increasing amounts of renewables, especially wind. Coal has a high share in total installed capacity in most countries and it will put high pressures on these countries in the context of undergoing changes and decarbonisation in electricity sector of European Union and Energy Community. Obviously, the electricity sector will face huge changes and is expected to contribute to the new energy revolution. However, during the 90s, the electricity sector of SEE countries changed dramatically. Generation and industrial demand have decreased considerably due to the wars and painful transition, while the household demand increased rapidly. This extensive use of electricity was stimulated by low electricity prices and poor payment discipline in most countries. Still, in recent years, electricity reforms and increase in electricity prices have improved energy efficiency and reduced deficits. SEE countries have started with reforms in electricity sector but the analysis shows that their progress is rather different. Despite the increase in electricity prices over the course of several years especially in new EU Member States, most SEE still have low electricity prices that are not cost-based. Regarding the quality of electricity supply, as it could be expected, Croatia as the best performer achieved the highest quality of electricity supply, while all other SEE countries are considerably lagging behind. As the analysis shows, sectoral characteristics, macroeconomic environment and institutional framework in SEE countries differ widely. Having in mind their different reform results, it is reasonable to question the uniform EU reform model that has been implemented in all SEE countries. It seems that this model cannot be appropriate for all countries since it requires adequate level of institutional resources that are missing in less developed and small transition countries of Southeast Europe.

Climate change is seriously affecting the whole world economy, society, and environment. As our ultimate goal of sustainable development is the harmony and balance of economic growth, environmental preservation, and social equity, actively taking action against climate change is a key element for the development. Around 1 trillion dollars is supposed to be used as 'Budgets to restrain carbon dioxide emissions' in the next 89 years. The Emissions Gap Report published by the UNEP on 20th of November, 2014 traced the gap between targets for decarbonisation released by each country and actual amount of carbon emission with the remaining budget kept.I think that the measures of climate change should primarily be extended to the level of human being's understanding to ensure the sustainable development. To support this suggestion, I am going to investigate climate change based on the literatures such as Entropy , The Empathic Civilization: The race to global consciousness in a world in crisis , The Third Industrial Revolution of Jeremy Rifikin.				향후 100년 이내에 지구의 온도가 1.5℃에서 3.5℃ 이상 상승하면 모든 생물가운데 최소 20%, 최대 70%가 멸종할 가능성이 있다고 IPCC(Intergovermental Panel Climate Change, IPPC)는 추산한다. 기후변화는 경제, 사회, 환경에 큰 영향을 미치고 있다. 지속가능발전은 경제성장과 환경보전의 균형, 그리고 사회적 형평성을 추구하고 있기에 기후변화에 대한 적극적인 대응이 지속가능발전의 핵심적인 요소라 할 수 있다. 향후 89년간 사용할 지구의 '탄소 예산'은 1조 톤 정도를 헤아린다.지난 2014년 11월 20일 유엔환경계획(UNEP)이 발간한 '2014 목표 대비 세계 탄소 배출량 격차 보고서(The Emissions Gap Report)'에서 세계 각국이 발표한 탄소감축목표와 지구의 남은 탄소예산을 지킬 수 있는 실제 목표 배출량 사이의 배출량 격차를 추적했다. 필자는 지속가능한 발전을 담보하기 위해 기후변화의 문제를 인류가 공감의 차원으로 확장해 나가야 한다고 본다. 이를 뒷받침하는 차원에서 필자는 제러미 리프킨((Jeremy Rifikin)의  엔트로피  ,  공감의 시대  ,  3차 산업혁명  등의 저서를 중심으로 기후변화 논의를 고찰하고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1738-8988			KJD:ART002062914		J	Lu Yan-li; Bai You-lu; Yang Li-ping; Wang Lei; Wang Yi-lun; Ni Lu; Zhou Li-ping								Hyper-spectral characteristics and classification of farmland soil in northeast of China								JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE				14	12			2521	2528		10.1016/S2095-3119(15)61232-1				2015	2015	The physical and chemical heterogeneities of soils make the soil spectral different and complicated, and it is valuable to increase the accuracy of prediction models for soil organic matter (SOM) based on pre-classification. This experiment was conducted under a controllable environment, and different soil samples from northeast of China were measured using ASD2500 hyperspectral instrument. The results showed that there are different reflectances in different soil types. There are statistically significant correlation between SOM and reflectence at 0.05 and 0.01 levels in 550-850 nnn, and all soil types get significant at 0.01 level in 650-750 nnn. The results indicated that soil types of the northeast can be divided into three categories: The first category shows relatively flat and low reflectance in the entire band; the second shows that the spectral reflectance curve raises fastest in 460-610 nm band, the sharp increase in the slope, but uneven slope changes; the third category slowly uplifts in the visible band, and its slope in the visible band is obviously higher than the first category. Except for the classification by curve shapes of reflectance, principal component analysis is one more effective method to classify soil types. The first principal component includes 62.13-97.19% of spectral information and it mainly relates to the information in 560-600, 630-690 and 690-760 nm. The second mainly represents spectral information in 1 640-1 740, 2050-2 120 and 2 200-2 300 nnn. The samples with high OM are often in the left, and the others with low OM are in the right of the scatter plot (the first principal component is the horizontal axis and the second is the longitudinal axis). Soil types in northeast of China can be classified effectively by those two principles; it is also a valuable reference to other soil in other areas.									6	2	0	4	0	7	1	17	2095-3119			WOS:000367633200013		S	Zeng, Jun; Zhou, Ming; Pan, Yan-Chun; Zhou, Mei-Rong; Sun, Ruo-Nan						Wang, M		Policy Evaluation on Regional Emission Trade Market-A Simulation Analysis								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT INNOVATION		AEBMR-Advances in Economics Business and Management Research		6				491	496						2015	2015	With greatly enhanced economic development and human material, social development and the contradiction between the human bearing capacities of the environment is increasingly highlighted, in response to dramatic changes in climate, various countries have proposed a series of controlling greenhouse gas reduction exclusive strategies and initiatives. Carbon emission trade programs started since 2011 in China, seven cities/provinces were chosen as pilot areas, and a unified national carbon emission trade market is planned for commission at the end of 2016. The attendant problems of various carbon emission policies are validation and appropriateness. This study simulates the enterprises participating in a dynamic and uncertain carbon trade market and making carbon resource acquisition/disposition decisions under the impact of government policies regarding the control, quota allocation and auction, and emission reduction. It summarized, characterized, and analyzed the efficiency of the government policies under a Cap and Trade (C&T) condition in the management of a regional emission trade market.

The contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to evaluate the value people are willing to pay (WTP) for the environmentally sound functions of environmentally friendly agriculture. Based on the pilot survey results, virtual scenarios were set up and a double-bounded dichotomous choice survey was conducted. This study selected 3 domains of environmentally sound functions: soil and water-related, protecting biodiversity, greenhouse gas reduction. Economic assessments of the environmentally sound functions of environmentally friendly agriculture were conducted using the maximum likelihood estimation method.

Developing Woody Crops for the Enhancement of Ecosystem Services under Changing Climates in the North Central United States								Journal of forest and environmental science				31	2			78	90						2015	2015	Short rotation woody crops belonging to the genera Populus L., Salix L., Pinus L., and Eucalyptus L'Her. have provided broad economic and ecological benefits throughout the world, including afforestation and reforestation along urban to rural gradients. Within the genus Populus, cottonwoods, poplars, aspens, and their hybrids (hereafter referred to as poplars) have been shown to exhibit favorable genotype × environment interactions, especially in the face of changing climates. Similar growth responses have been reported for Pinus, especially with white pine (Pinus strobus L.) in the North Central United States. This has led to current research priorities focused on ecosystem services for both genera. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) defines cultural, supporting, provisioning, and regulating ecosystem services. The overarching objective of this paper was to synthesize information about the potential of poplars to provide multiple ecosystem services when grown at sites with varying soil and climate conditions across landscape gradients from urban to rural areas. Specific objectives included: 1) providing background of the United States Forest Service and its Research and Development branch, 2) integrating knowledge of current poplar breeding and development with biomass provisioning and carbon regulating ecosystem services as they relate to changing climates in the North Central United States, and 3) providing a case study illustrating this integration through comparisons of poplar with white pine. Our results were evaluated in the context of climate change mitigation, with specific focus on selection of favorable genotypes for sequestering atmospheric carbon and reducing fossil fuel carbon emissions.									5	0	0	2	0	5	0	5	2288-9744			KJD:ART001995679		J	Hyun, Koh Moon								The Outline of German Act on the Demonstration of the Permanent Storage of Carbon Dioxide and Its evaluation								Public Land Law Review	토지공법연구			69				469	493						2015	2015	The energy and climate debate is among today's most pressing and most relevant points of discussion. There are different strategies for meeting the future energy demand without harming the climate.Carbon dioxide capture and storage(CCS) is a climate change mitigation option that reduces CO2 emissions by capturing them at major fossil fuel combustion plants and other industrial facilities such as bitumen upgrades, and storing them underground.Exactly because nuclear energy will be banned in Germany in the future, CCS will increasingly be in the focus of the debate on climate protection, since at the moment, renewable energies are not yet sufficiently available to guarantee a nationwide energy supply.Under these circumstances, recourse to energy generation from coal is the most obvious option. CCS might make this type of energy generation a low-carbon option.Therefore, Germany tried to make Carbon Dioxide Storage Act, KSpG(Kohlendioxid- Speicherungsgesetz) in short German. But the first proposal of German Carbon Dioxide Storage Act(2009) did not pass in the Senate (Bundesrat) because of unsolved safety risk and ambiguous liability.Especially, people of potential carbon dioxide storage site opposed this proposal. Therefore, we can learn a lot from trials and errors of German Carbon Dioxide Storage Act. We can’t emphasize the importance of public acceptance on CCS too much.Currently some Korean ministries such as Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries are preparing for an act on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Bearing in mind bitter experiences of Germany, we should make every effort to make a good act on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage with sharing information and knowhow between ministries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1226-251X			KJD:ART001992708		J	Anand, S.; Gupta, A.; Tyagi, S.

The solar energy is one of the readily available forms of renewable energy which can be used to operate the cooling equipments depending on the geographical location of the area where solar cooling system needs to be installed. The effectiveness of solar cooling also needs to be evaluated based on various performance indicating parameters. However, different types of solar collectors also need to be evaluated in order to find out their feasibility for cooling applications. Thus in this article review of different types of solar cooling technologies have been carried out. The study reveals that evacuated tube collectors are best option for solar cooling where as desiccant cooling helps in improving the indoor air quality. Also, thermal energy storage and ejector based solar cooling efficiently improves the performance besides energy saving. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of the built environment, the emphasis is on increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, whereas other building life cycle phases are generally considered less important. However, in recent research it has been suggested that more attention should be given to construction phases, including emissions embodied in materials. They occur in early life cycle stages whereas a large share of use-phase related emissions occur outside the existing climate change mitigation target years, and, due to development in energy sector, might significantly deviate from what is projected today. In this study, by using the life cycle assessment (LCA), we assess the greenhouse gas emissions related to the materials and construction of a low-energy multi-storey residential building in Finland. We depict how the emissions are allocated to the different building systems and look for opportunities to reduce the emissions from this perspective. The novelty of the study arises from two factors: (1) we utilize the wide assessment scope that enables depicting the importance of the boundary decision and (2) not many construction-phase LCA studies of modern low-energy residential buildings exist.

The task is even more challenging in Malaysia considering the occurrence of sequence of floods within the past and the need to be a part of the developed economy by 2020 which needs environment protection. This paper examines the state of climate change mitigation and the practice of voluntary carbon disclosure in sustainable development practice among listed Property companies in Malaysia. Consequently the paper analyses policies and programs on-going in Malaysia to create an enabling environment for the implementation of climate change mitigation. From the studies, it can argued that Malaysia has made significant progress in setting up legal framework for the implementation of climate change mitigation and voluntary environmental disclosure, but critical mass is yet to be achieved. This was achieved as a function of Malaysia's membership to United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and also participates in the Clean Development Mechanism; and further establishes nationwide ecological protection laws which are implemented in the government's Development Plans and development industry master plan. Lastly, the impetus given to the free market sector to be participants in mitigation through the Bursa Malaysia listing requirement that specifies corporate social responsibility reporting as part of the annual reports, with measurement, disclosure and management of emission integral part. The review allows us to infer that the Malaysia voluntary environmental disclosure and climate change mitigation practice in the property sector has made initial progress but there is need for more market driven motivation to be introduced so that more companies especially those in carbon-intensive practice would be involved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0127-9696	2180-3722		WOS:000218623100006		J	Mendez, Michael Anthony								Assessing local climate action plans for public health co-benefits in environmental justice communities								LOCAL ENVIRONMENT				20	6	SI		637	663		10.1080/13549839.2015.1038227				2015	2015	Climate change presents a complex environmental health and justice challenge for the field of urban planning. To date, the majority of research focuses on measuring local climate efforts and evaluating the general efficacy of adopted climate action plans (CAPs). Cumulatively, these studies argue that socio-economic and demographic variables (such as the fiscal health of cities, city size, and median household income) are important factors in implementing climate policies. Less studied are issues of environmental justice and the impacts of climate change on population health. Through interviews with urban planners and a document analysis of CAPs, this study assesses how California cities with high levels of pollution and social vulnerability address climate change and public health. The findings of this study show that CAPs in these cities rarely analyse whether greenhouse gas reduction strategies will also yield health co-benefits, such as a reduction in the co-pollutants of climate change (i.e. ozone, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides). In many instances, the net co-benefits of health are not monetised, quantified, or even identified by local governments. In California's most impacted cities, climate planning activities and work on public health are happening in a parallel manner rather than through an integrated approach. The results suggest a need for increased opportunities for interagency coordination and staff training to conduct health analyses, free and easily accessible tools, methods for prioritising funding streams, and the development of partnerships with community-based organisations for linking climate planning with public health.									3	0	0	0	0	3	5	15	1354-9839	1469-6711		WOS:000212149000003		J	Hofmann, Marina; Muller, Nikolas D.; Stankiewicz, Christoph J.; Pfnur, Andreas; Linke, Hans Joachim								The effects of knowledge orders on climate change policy in urban land management and real estate management: a case study of three German cities								URBAN RESEARCH & PRACTICE				8	3	SI		336	353		10.1080/17535069.2015.1051381				2015	2015	Local climate policy depends on a transformation of the built environment. In urban areas, the built environment is largely an integrated product of land management and real estate management. This paper examines the effects of sense-making on urban climate policies in the built environment. Three major German cities are analysed in a comparative case study. The structuring element for both qualitative and quantitative data analyses is the concept of knowledge orders (Heinelt and Lamping in this issue). This study demonstrates the important role that the selection of beliefs, ideas and knowledge play in the development of local strategies against climate change by identifying a strong relationship between local knowledge orders and climate policy. The paper contributes to the urban policy literature by improving the understanding of local differences, including how knowledge orders affect land management and real estate management.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1753-5069	1753-5077		WOS:000214421200005		J	Hong, Sanghyun; Bradshaw, Corey J.

For this reason, published future electricity scenarios aimed at policy makers for this country have not seriously considered a full mix of energy options. Here we addressed this deficiency by comparing the life-cycle sustainability of published scenarios using multi-criteria decision-making analysis, and modeling the optimized future electricity mix using a genetic algorithm. The published 'CSIRO e-future' scenario under its default condition (excluding nuclear) has the largest aggregate negative environmental and economic outcomes (score = 4.51 out of 8), followed by the Australian Energy Market Operator's 100% renewable energy scenario (4.16) and the Greenpeace scenario (3.97). The e-future projection with maximum nuclear-power penetration allowed yields the lowest negative impacts (1.46). After modeling possible future electricity mixes including or excluding nuclear power, the weighted criteria recommended an optimized scenario mix where nuclear power generated >40% of total electricity. The life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of the optimization scenarios including nuclear power were <27 kg CO2-e MW h(-1) in 2050, which achieves the IPCC's target of 50-150 kg CO2-e MW h(-1). Our analyses demonstrate clearly that nuclear power is an effective and logical option for the environmental and economic sustainability of a future electricity network in Australia.

Method of power generation portfolio optimization, as function of sustainability and decarbonisation, along with appropriate criteria, has been proposed. Application of this optimization method has been demonstrated on a real power system - power utility JP Elektroprivreda BiH d.d. - Sarajevo (EPBiH), a typical example of South East European power system. The software tool WASP IV has been employed in the analysis, in order to define the dynamics and an optimized expansion of generation portfolio of the power system under consideration for the next period. The mid-term generation portfolio development plan for the EPBiH power system until year 2030 has been made during this research, taking into account the shutdown dynamics of existing power units and commissioning new ones, in order to provide safe supply of electric and heat energy for local consumers. Three basic scenario of renewable energy sources (RES) expansion have been analysed to reach specific RES and decarbonisation targets set for 2030, including RES share increase from the current level of 18% up to 35% (LOW RES), 45% (MID RES) and 55% (HIGH RES). Effects to the sustainability are considered through environmental, economic and social indicators. Multicriteria sustainability assessment gave an advantage to the HIGH RES, under assumption of equal weighting factors of economic and environment groups of indicators. Also, single criteria analysis has been made to support sustainability assessment. Results show that, considering the EPBiH generation portfolio planned under HIGH RES, 49% CO2 emissions cut in 2030 compared to 1990 is possible along with further increase of overall energy efficiency of the system. The proposed model can be used in conventional power systems for generation portfolio development as function of specific RES and decarbonisation targets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Most available energy/economy/environment/engineering (E4) modelling tools focus however on technology and fuel switching and tend to poorly incorporate mitigation options from travel behaviour, and in particular, switching between modes is not an option. This paper describes a novel methodology for incorporating competition between private cars, buses and trains in a least-cost linear optimisation E4 model, called TIMES. This is achieved by imposing a constraint on overall travel time in the system, which represents the empirically observed fixed travel time budget (TUB) of individuals, and introducing a cost for infrastructural investments (travel time investment, TT), which reduces the travel time of public transport. Two case studies from California and Ireland are developed using a simple TIMES model, and results are generated to 2030 for a reference scenario, an investments scenario and a CO2 emissions reduction scenario. The results show that with no travel time constraint, the model chooses public transport exclusively. With a travel time constraint, mode choice is determined by income and investment cost assumptions, and the level of CO2 constraint, with greater levels of public transport in the mitigation scenario. At low travel investment cost, new rail is introduced for short distances and increased bus capacity for longer distances. At higher investment costs rail is increasingly chosen for long distances also. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Green urban infrastructure has been regarded as beneficial, e.g. by balancing water flows, providing thermal comfort. This article explores the existing evidence on the contribution of green spaces to climate change mitigation and adaptation services. We suggest a framework of ecosystem services for systematizing the evidence on the provision of bio-physical benefits (e.g. CO2 sequestration) as well as social and psychological benefits (e.g. improved health) that enable coping with (adaptation) or reducing the adverse effects (mitigation) of climate change. The multi-functional and multi-scale nature of green urban infrastructure complicates the categorization of services and benefits, since in reality the interactions between various benefits are manifold and appear on different scales. We will show the relevance of the benefits from green urban infrastructures on three spatial scales (i.e. city, neighborhood and site specific scales). We will further report on co-benefits and trade-offs between the various services indicating that a benefit could in turn be detrimental in relation to other functions. The manuscript identifies avenues for further research on the role of green urban infrastructure, in different types of cities, climates and social contexts. Our systematic understanding of the bio-physical and social processes defining various services allows targeting stressors that may hamper the provision of green urban infrastructure services in individual behavior as well as in wider planning and environmental management in urban areas.

It explores attitudes toward the environment in general and then, more specifically, toward global warming and global warming-mitigation technologies. It also explores student understanding of sources of carbon dioxide and climate change-mitigation technologies, such as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Further, it analyses responses to questions about willingness of respondents to pay to solve global warming. The data was collected in October and November of 2011 using a structured questionnaire which was first formulated in English and then translated into Greek. The analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS v17.0 and focused on descriptive statistics, in order to compare the average ratings for the different statements.The present study concludes that university students in Greece are overwhelmingly positively disposed towards the environment with the majority of respondents believing that protecting the environment should have priority over economic considerations. Students also view the effects of global warming as serious enough to warrant action and state their belief that the current generation should meet its own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. Moreover, the majority of the participants are against the development of nuclear energy, favoring RES (solar wind and bioenergy), and energy conservation technologies. However, the study has also identified a lack of understanding in regards to sources of carbon dioxide. The majority of the respondents do not seem to know that oceans act as sinks of CO2 emissions or that the housing stock is a significant contributor to this problem.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	1790-7632			WOS:000352253900006		J	Haldrup, Karin; Snallfot, David								On Financing of Urban Transition Viewed from the Oresund Area: When the Political Agenda of Urban Transition Meets the Market								SUSTAINABILITY				6	12			9057	9079		10.3390/su6129057				DEC 2014	2014	The "urban transition" agenda is as a conglomerate of ambitions derived from international policy documents and as applied in the Oresund area. Encompassing locally set goals for (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) energy efficiency; and (iii) human wellbeing in the built environment. Its implementation is largely dependent on private sector joining in, since transitioning the building stock is to be financed by the market. This paper explores strategies to meet this agenda in the Oresund area. A particular focus is on the refurbishment of multi-family housing relative to these set goals. The paper finds meaningful differences between Denmark and Sweden. In general, exceptionally high energy standards come at an additional cost that is likely to be incompatible with rational economic behavior. Furthermore, actions appropriate for one goal are likely to have modest effects on ancillary goals. The paper concludes by suggesting to revisit current strategies in the Oresund area to reflect market constraints and to promote more coherent ways to achieve the set goals.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	6	2071-1050			WOS:000346794700038		J	Hasaneen, Rasha; Elsayed, Nesreen A.; Barrufet, Maria A.								Analysis of the technical, microeconomic, and political impact of a carbon tax on carbon dioxide sequestration resulting from liquefied natural gas production								CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY				16	8	SI		1597	1613		10.1007/s10098-014-0735-6				DEC 2014	2014	With increasing attention to the environmental impact of discharging greenhouse gases (GHG) in general, and CO2 in particular, many are looking to carbon sequestration as an approach to reduce the carbon impact of stationary point sources of CO2. Although much of the focus has historically been on capturing and sequestering post-combustion CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, there are many industrial processes that already require separation of CO2 that also contribute to GHG emissions. This CO2 can also be sequestered. One such process is the commercial production of liquefied natural gas, which necessitates the separation of CO2 from the hydrocarbon for liquefaction; resulting in a relatively pure CO2 stream which can be sequestered. The Gorgon project is one such commercial project. In the broader political environment of Australia's carbon tax system and government grants to offset the capital investment in carbon abatement technologies, the economics of the Gorgon project can be analyzed to determine the technical and economic parameters that make the carbon sequestration more or less feasible for this self-contained project. These findings can then be applied to any such project where a pure CO2 is a necessary by-product and a carbon tax is either in effect or being considered. This analysis is the primary objective of this article. In this context, a computer-based simulator was developed to analyze the impact of technical, market, and public policy factors on project economics. A base case was developed using the current project parameters and a number of alternative scenarios were then developed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted and a "best case" scenario was developed to look at what the appetite for investment could be to improve the sequestration of CO2. The article demonstrates that CCS project competitiveness can be simulated to analyze the impact of key technological, market, and policy changes on the project.									14	0	0	0	0	14	1	37	1618-954X	1618-9558		WOS:000345075400011		J	Mahurin, Shannon M.; Fulvio, Pasquale F.; Hillesheim, Patrick C.; Nelson, Kimberly M.; Veith, Gabriel M.; Dai, Sheng				Dai, Sheng/K-8411-2015	Dai, Sheng/0000-0002-8046-3931; Veith, Gabriel/0000-0002-5186-4461			Directed Synthesis of Nanoporous Carbons from Task-Specific Ionic Liquid Precursors for the Adsorption of CO2								CHEMSUSCHEM				7	12			3284	3289		10.1002/cssc.201402338				DEC 2014	2014	Postcombustion CO2 capture has become a key component of greenhouse-gas reduction as anthropogenic emissions continue to impact the environment.

By varying the structure of the ionic liquid precursor, we were able to control pore architecture and surface functional groups of the carbon materials in this one-step synthesis process leading to adsorbents with high CO2 sorption capacities (up to 4.067 mmolg(-1)) at 0 degrees C and 1 bar.

This paper investigates the role that carbon markets could have in facilitating the implementation of composting, anaerobic digestion and biochar production, in the city of Tamale, in the North of Ghana. Through a life cycle assessment of implementation scenarios for lowtech, small scale variants of the above mentioned three technologies, the potential contribution they could give to climate change mitigation was assessed. Furthermore an economic assessment was carried out to study their viability and the impact thereon of accessing carbon markets. It was found that substantial climate benefits can be achieved by avoiding landfilling of organic waste, producing electricity and substituting the use of chemical fertilizer. Biochar production could result in a net carbon sequestration. These technologies were however found not to be economically viable without external subsidies, and access to carbon markets at the considered carbon price of 7 EUR/ton of carbon would not change the situation significantly. Carbon markets could help the realization of the considered composting and anaerobic digestion systems only if the carbon price will rise above 75-84 EUR/t of carbon (respectively for anaerobic digestion and composting). Biochar production could achieve large climate benefits and, if approved as a land based climate mitigation mechanism in carbon markets, it would become economically viable at the lower carbon price of 30 EUR/t of carbon.

Congo Basin countries, including Cameroon, have embraced the opportunities that REDD+ provides, with great expectations. Yet, it needs to be investigated whether the enabling institutional environment, which is required for implementing REDD+, is present. Understanding is still limited on how to build adequate and strong institutional relations that could shape the reforms towards the establishment of efficient emissions reductions schemes. Furthermore, uncertainty remains on the operational mechanisms of REDD+, suggesting that, to catalyse effectiveness, there is a need to come up with a governance model nested in relevant policy frameworks. This study builds on a modified '4Is' framework - Institutions, Interests, Ideas and Information - to analyse REDD+ and explore stakeholders' perceptions on the local forest governance potential. A structural implementation model to optimize the effectiveness of REDD+ is developed. Findings suggest that governments need to review existing policies to take into account participation, local people rights, and information access as a way to stimulate actors' willingness to contribute to emissions reductions and carbon stock increases under REDD+ regimes.									6	0	0	0	0	6	1	19	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000346471500006		J	Agrawal, Arun; Wollenberg, E.; Persha, L.

The review is based on a careful survey of 123 cases of project-based and policy interventions to influence land use and forest cover outcomes. We propose that outcomes of interventions can be explained in terms of rights, incentives, and technologies related to land use and apply this framework to examine 12 types of interventions in agriculture-forest landscapes. The analysis of the identified 123 cases raises concerns about consistency of data and comparability of cases. Our preliminary evidence suggests limited association between the stated objective of an intervention and its success. This evidence also suggests that smaller scale and effective enforcement may be positively associated with improved forest outcomes. But the effectiveness of interventions across different agriculture-forest landscapes varies and available evidence does not permit easy generalizations. The variable effects of interventions across different agriculture-forest landscapes point to the need to better understand the forms and functions of interventions and to problems associated with assessing their relative efficacy.

These inter-related ecosystem services provide key opportunities in securing climate change mitigation and adaptation. Their integrated management in the face of climate change, however, can be confounded by fragmentation within the complex institutional arrangements concerned with natural resource management. This suggests the need for a more systemic approach to continuous improvement in the integrated and adaptive governance of natural resources.This paper explores the theoretical foundations for integrated natural resource management and reviews positive systemic improvements that have been emerging in the Australian context. In setting clear theoretical foundations, the paper explores both functional and structural aspects of natural resource governance systems. Functional considerations include issues of connectivity, knowledge use and capacity within the natural resource decision making environment. Structural considerations refer to the institutions and processes that undertake planning through to implementation, monitoring and evaluation.From this foundation, we review the last decade of emerging initiatives in governance regarding the integration of agriculture and forests across the entire Australian landscape. This includes the shift towards more devolved regional approaches to integrated natural resource management and recent progress towards the use of terrestrial carbon at landscape scale to assist in climate change mitigation and adaptation. These developments, however, have also been tempered by a significant raft of new landscape-scale regulations that have tended to be based on a more centralist philosophy that landowners should be providing ecosystem services for the wider public good without substantive reward.Given this background, we explore a case study of efforts taken to integrate the management of landscape-scale agro-ecological services in the Wet Tropics of tropical Queensland. This is being achieved primarily through the integration of regional natural resource management planning and the development of aggregated terrestrial carbon offset products at a whole of landscape scale via the Degree Celsius initiative. Finally, the paper teases out the barriers and opportunities being experienced, leading to discussion about the global implications for managing climate change, income generation and poverty reduction.

Policy innovation theory suggests that some shared internal characteristics should distinguish the localities that adopt those policies from others that do not. Based on a survey of US local government officials, and supplementary data from the US Census, we use multiple regression analysis to identify those distinguishing characteristics. We find that collaborative planning approaches play a crucial role in helping localities build the local civic capacity necessary to adopt these innovative policies. Our results reinforce prior studies which have found that citizen participation and stakeholder participation in planning processes can help to foster the development of innovative local policies for sustainability and climate change mitigation.

However, before the popularity of urban sustainability concept, land use and transport interaction had been scrutinized as strictly separate entities in the urban planning and development domains. Fortunately, today the concept of sustainability has been pushed to the forefront of policy-making and politics as the world wakes up to the impacts of climate change and the effects of the rapid urbanization and modern urban lifestyles. The paper therefore aims to highlight the importance of the interplay between transport, land use and the environment. This review paper provides evidence from the literature including the Transport, Land Use and the Environment Special Issue contributions and global best practice cases to showcase new empirical approaches and investigations from different parts of the world that contribute to the wealth of knowledge in exploring the interplay between transport, land use and the environment thoroughly.									29	0	0	2	0	29	1	44	1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000345079100001		J	Dodds, Paul E.

We review how heat provision is represented in UK MARKAL, identifying a number of shortcomings and areas for improvement. We present a completely revised model with improved estimations of future heat demands and a consistent representation of all heat generation technologies. This model represents all heat delivery infrastructure for the first time and uses dynamic growth constraints to improve the modelling of transitions according to innovation theory. Our revised model incorporates a simplified housing stock model, which is used produce highly-refined decarbonisation pathways for residential heat provision. We compare this disaggregated model against an aggregated equivalent, which is similar to the existing approach in UK MARKAL. Disaggregating does not greatly change the total residential fuel consumption in two scenarios, so the benefits of disaggregation will likely be limited if the focus of a study is elsewhere. Yet for studies of residential heat, disaggregation enables us to vary consumer behaviour and government policies on different house types, as well as highlighting different technology trends across the stock, in comparison with previous aggregated versions of the model.

Blue carbon is therefore of considerable interest to the scientific and policy communities, and is frequently discussed in relation to carbon markets and climate finance opportunities. This paper identifies peer-reviewed and 'gray literature' documents that discuss blue carbon in the context of finance and market mechanisms. The document set is analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the principal scientific, economic, regulatory, social, and management issues that emerge are discussed. The study reveals that (1) the blue carbon literature is dominated by technical and policy commentary, with a dearth of research into practical social considerations and a stark absence of private sector perspectives; (2) there is confusion over the nature and role of important concepts including private and public sector finance and instruments; and (3) understanding of the important issues of investment priorities and risk considerations is also limited. This paper therefore identifies gaps in the blue carbon literature, clarifies critical concepts and issues, and proposes novel pathways for blue carbon research and project development (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It does so by analyzing input and output legitimacy of the two certification standards at the global level, and at national and local levels in Peru. The findings show an increasing interest among REDD+ actors in using these standards, and a relatively large number of Peruvian REDD+ projects that are certified by the FSC or CCBA. The findings also suggest intrinsic linkages between input and output legitimacy of the FSC and CCBA within single governance levels and across different scales. The article also demonstrates the added value of studying the legitimacy of policy instruments, such as the FSC and CCBA, in a specific context such as REDD+.

Several studies have demonstrated that spectral nudging improves the representation of regional climate in reanalysis-forced simulations compared with not using nudging in the interior of the domain. However, in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, spectral nudging tends to produce degraded precipitation simulations when compared to analysis nudgingan interior constraint technique that is scale indiscriminate but also operates on moisture fields which until now could not be altered directly by spectral nudging. Since analysis nudging is less desirable for regional climate modeling because it dampens fine-scale variability, changes are proposed to the spectral nudging methodology to capitalize on differences between the nudging techniques and aim to improve the representation of clouds, radiation, and precipitation without compromising other fields. These changes include adding spectral nudging toward moisture, limiting nudging to below the tropopause, and increasing the nudging time scale for potential temperature, all of which collectively improve the representation of mean and extreme precipitation, 2 m temperature, clouds, and radiation, as demonstrated using a model-simulated 20 year historical period. Such improvements to WRF may increase the fidelity of regional climate data used to assess the potential impacts of climate change on human health and the environment and aid in climate change mitigation and adaptation studies.									18	3	0	2	0	20	0	12	2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000345298100019		J	Al-Kalbani, Mohammed Saif; Price, Martin F.; Abahussain, Asma; Ahmed, Mushtaque; O'Higgins, Timothy				Ahmed, Mushtaque/H-3739-2019; O'Higgins, Tim/G-6717-2015	Ahmed, Mushtaque/0000-0002-8664-7790; O'Higgins, Tim/0000-0003-1274-4480			Vulnerability Assessment of Environmental and Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman								WATER				6	10			3118	3135		10.3390/w6103118				OCT 2014	2014	Climate change and its consequences present one of the most important threats to water resources systems which are vulnerable to such changes due to their limited adaptive capacity. Water resources in arid mountain regions, such as Al Jabal Al Akhdar; northern Sultanate of Oman, are vulnerable to the potential adverse impacts of environmental and climate change. Besides climatic change, current demographic trends, economic development and related land use changes are exerting pressures and have direct impacts on increasing demands for water resources and their vulnerability. In this study, vulnerability assessment was carried out using guidelines prepared by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Peking University to evaluate four components of the water resource system: water resources stress, water development pressure, ecological health, and management capacity. The calculated vulnerability index (VI) was high, indicating that the water resources are experiencing levels of stress. Ecosystem deterioration was the dominant parameter and management capacity was the dominant category driving the vulnerability on water resources. The vulnerability assessment will support policy and decision makers in evaluating options to modify existing policies. It will also help in developing long-term strategic plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and implement effective policies for sustainable water resources management, and therefore the sustenance of human wellbeing in the region.									18	4	0	4	0	20	0	34	2073-4441			WOS:000344358200014		J	Duguma, Lalisa A.; Wambugu, Susan W.; Minang, Peter A.; van Noordwijk, Meine					van Noordwijk, Meine/0000-0002-7791-4703; Duguma, Lalisa/0000-0001-8282-4406			A systematic analysis of enabling conditions for synergy between climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY				42				138	148		10.1016/j.envsci.2014.06.003				OCT 2014	2014	There is a growing quest for synergy between mitigation and adaptation due to concerns of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the compartmentalized approaches to climate change.

This paper proposes an analytical framework to assess enabling conditions for synergies at the national level and applies it to developing countries to explore the potential move toward synergy. Four enabling conditions for integrating adaptation and mitigation, i.e. policies and strategies, programs and projects, institutional arrangements and financial mechanisms, were used to score developing countries relative to each other. We hypothesized that low income and vulnerable countries might more likely pursue synergy given the urgency for both adaptation and mitigation. Despite the relative infancy of the synergy concept, about half of countries studied exhibited good synergy potential, 80% of which were middle-income developing countries. The assumption of vulnerability as a precursor for pursuing synergy was supported by the fact that small island states possessed relatively high synergy potential. Income was weakly associated with the synergy potential with least developed countries having low synergy scores. Emerging economies possessed strong synergy potential which might be associated with better capacity available and/or potential for shaping their global images due to their growing emissions. In sum, the proposed analytical framework could be useful to identify areas of emphasis to promote holistic and efficient climate policies. As this study largely focused on the enabling conditions, further studies are needed to scrutinize and manage the mitigation-adaptation balances in countries possessing good synergy potentials.

Our objective was to establish the extent to which hospital environmental sustainability has been studied and the key issues that emerge for policy, practice and research.Methods The PubMed, Engineering Village, Cochrane and King's Fund databases were searched for articles relating to hospital environmental sustainability published in English between 1 January 1990 and 1 October 2013. Further studies were found by review of reference lists. One hundred ninety-three relevant articles were found and 76 were selected for inclusion in the review.Results Common research themes were identified: hospital design, direct energy consumption, water, procurement, waste, travel and psychology and behaviour. Some countries (particularly the United Kingdom) have begun to invest systematically in understanding the environmental effects of hospitals. We found large variability in the extent of the evidence base according to topic. Research regarding the architectural fabric of hospital buildings is at a relatively mature stage. Similarly, there is a developed research base regarding devices and technologies used within hospitals to reduce the environmental effects of direct hospital energy and water use. Less is known about the clinical, psychological and social factors that influence how health care professionals use resources, travel to/from hospital, and interact with the buildings and technologies available. A significant part of the environmental footprint of hospitals relates to clinical practice, e.g. decisions regarding the use of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Medical cradle to grave' life cycle assessment studies have been published to understand the full financial and environmental costs of hospital activities. The effects of preventive or demand management measures which avoid unnecessary hospital procedures are likely to be much greater than incremental changes to how hospital procedures are performed.Conclusions There remain significant gaps in the evidence base on hospital sustainability. Assessments of environmental impacts and natural resource use are beginning to be produced, both at the level of individual hospitals and at the health system level. These are an important start, but in many areas do not yet provide sufficiently detailed information to guide decision-making. There are many areas where the interests of patients and the environment coincide, but others where tensions exist. Rising resource costs and climate change mitigation measures are likely to create an increasing stimulus for research on hospital sustainability. Such research will benefit from inter-disciplinary coordination across research funders and countries.									29	2	0	5	0	31	4	78	1355-8196	1758-1060		WOS:000342802100009	24813186	J	Lorenz, Klaus; Lal, Rattan								Biochar application to soil for climate change mitigation by soil organic carbon sequestration								JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE				177	5			651	670		10.1002/jpln.201400058				OCT 2014	2014	Pyrogenic carbon (C) is produced by incomplete combustion of fuels including organic matter (OM). Certain ranges in the combustion continuum are termed 'black carbon' (BC). Because of its assumed persistence, surface soils in large parts of the world contain BC with up to 80% of surface soil organic C (SOC) stocks and up to 32% of subsoil SOC in agricultural soils consisting of BC. High SOC stocks and high levels of soil fertility in some ancient soils containing charcoal (e. g., terra preta de Indio) have recently been used as strategies for soil applications of biochar, an engineered BC material similar to charcoal but with the purposeful use as a soil conditioner (1) to mitigate increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by SOC sequestration and (2) to enhance soil fertility. However, effects of biochar on soils and crop productivity cannot be generalized as they are biochar-, plant-and site-specific. For example, the largest potential increases in crop yields were reported in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those characterizing much of the humid tropics. Soils of high inherent fertility, characterizing much of the world's important agricultural areas, appear to be less likely to benefit from biochar. It has been hypothesized that both liming and aggregating/moistening effects of biochar improved crop productivity. Meta-analyses of biochar effects on SOC sequestration have not yet been reported. To effectively mitigate climate change by SOC sequestration, a net removal of C and storage in soil relative to atmospheric CO 2 must occur and persist for several hundred years to a few millennia. At deeper soil depths, SOC is characterized by long turnover times, enhanced stabilization, and less vulnerability to loss by decomposition and erosion. In fact, some studies have reported preferential long-term accumulation of BC at deeper depths. Thus, it is hypothesized that surface applied biochar-C (1) must be translocated to subsoil layers and (2) result in deepening of SOC distribution for a notable contribution to climate change mitigation. Detailed studies are needed to understand how surface-applied biochar can move to deeper soil depths, and how its application affects organic C input to deeper soil depths. Based on this knowledge, biochar systems for climate change mitigation through SOC sequestration can be designed. It is critically important to identify mechanisms underlying the sometimes observed negative effects of biochar application on biomass, yield and SOC as biochar may persist in soils for long periods of time as well as the impacts on downstream environments and the net climate impact when biochar particles become airborne.									56	1	0	40	0	57	15	312	1436-8730	1522-2624		WOS:000342852200001		J	Al-Hassani, Amjed A.; Abbas, Hazzim F.; Daud, W.

In this work, COx-free hydrogen was produced by the thermal catalytic decomposition (TCD) of methane by a carbon catalyst. Deactivated catalysts at four-stage of progressive were characterized by nitrogen sorption and scanning electron microscopy. TCD of methane at 820 and 940 degrees C was about 13- and 8-folds higher than noncatalytic decomposition, respectively. High temperatures positively affected the kinetics of hydrogen production but negatively influenced the total amount of hydrogen and carbon products. The total pore volume was a good indicator of the total amount of hydrogen product. Catalyst activity was decreased because of the changes in the catalyst's textural properties within three ranges of relative time, that is, 0 to 45, 0.45 to 0.65, and 0.65 to 1. Models for specific surface area and total pore volume as functions of catalyst deactivation kinetics were developed. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce health impacts into a simple economic integrated assessment model where both the local cooling effect of SO2 and the global warming effect of CO2 are endogenous, and investigate how these factors affect the equilibrium path. Regions do not respond in the same way to climate change. In particular, emission abatement rates and health costs depend on the economic and geographical characteristics of each region. Two policy scenarios are considered, Nash and Optimal, for which we present both global and regional results. Results for Africa and China are highlighted.									8	0	0	3	0	8	2	24	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000342427700018		J	Gregory, Stephen D.; Ancrenaz, Marc; Brook, Barry W.; Goossens, Benoit; Alfred, Raymond; Ambu, Laurentius N.; Fordham, Damien A.

By reconnecting isolated fragments, habitat corridors should dampen the synergistic impacts of habitat and climate change on population viability. Choosing which fragments to reconnect is typically informed by past and current environmental conditions. However, habitat and climate are dynamic and change over time. Habitat suitability projections could inform fragment selection using current and future conditions, ensuring that corridors connect persistent fragments. We compare the efficacy of using current-day and future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement under land cover and climate-change mitigation and no mitigation scenarios by evaluating their influence on subpopulation abundance, and connectivity and long-term metapopulation abundance. Our case study is the threatened orangutan metapopulation in Sabah.Location Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.Methods Using coupled niche-population models that capture a metapopulation distribution and its major processes, we forecast the effect of current-day and future-informed habitat corridor implementations under two scenarios where (1) land cover and climate change continue unabated (no mitigation) and (2) local and international cooperation mitigates their synergistic impact (mitigation).Results We show that Future-informed corridor placement maximizes longterm metapopulation abundance when human-driven land cover and climate change alter the spatio-temporal composition of suitable habitat. By contrast, there is no apparent benefit in using future forecasts of breeding habitat to inform corridor placement if conditions remain comparatively stable. For the Sabah orangutan under unabated land cover and climate change, habitat corridors should connect current-day populated eastern habitat fragments with vacant fragments in the state's west.Main conclusions The efficacy of habitat corridors can be improved by using habitat-suitability model projections to inform corridor placement in rapidly changing environments, even for long-lived, low-fecundity, philopatric species such as orangutan.									8	0	0	6	0	8	2	103	1366-9516	1472-4642		WOS:000340426300005		J	Brand, Christian; Goodman, Anna; Ogilvie, David		iConnect Consortium			Rutter, Harry/0000-0002-9322-0656; Brand, Christian/0000-0002-1535-5328			Evaluating the impacts of new walking and cycling infrastructure on carbon dioxide emissions from motorized travel: A controlled longitudinal study								APPLIED ENERGY				128				284	295		10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.04.072				SEP 1 2014	2014	Walking and cycling is widely assumed to substitute for at least some motorized travel and thereby reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. While the evidence suggests that a supportive built environment may be needed to promote walking and cycling, it is unclear whether and how interventions in the built environment that attract walkers and cyclists may reduce transport CO2 emissions. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the effects of providing new infrastructure for walking and cycling on CO2 emissions from motorized travel.A cohort of 1849 adults completed questionnaires at baseline (2010) and one-year follow-up (2011), before and after the construction of new high-quality routes provided as part of the Sustrans Connect2 programme in three UK municipalities. A second cohort of 1510 adults completed questionnaires at baseline and two-year follow-up (2012). The participants reported their past-week travel behaviour and car characteristics from which CO2 emissions by mode and purpose were derived using methods described previously. A set of exposure measures of proximity to and use of the new routes were derived.Overall transport CO2 emissions decreased slightly over the study period, consistent with a secular trend in the case study regions. As found previously the new infrastructure was well used at one- and two-year follow-up, and was associated with population-level increases in walking, cycling and physical activity at two-year follow-up. However, these effects did not translate into sizeable CO2 effects as neither living near the infrastructure nor using it predicted changes in CO2 emissions from motorized travel, either overall or disaggregated by journey purpose. This lack of a discernible effect on travel CO2 emissions are consistent with an interpretation that some of those living nearer the infrastructure may simply have changed where they walked or cycled, while others may have walked or cycled more but few, if any, may have substituted active for motorized modes of travel as a result of the interventions. While the findings to date cannot exclude the possibility of small effects of the new routes on CO2 emissions, a more comprehensive approach of a higher 'dosage' of active travel promotion linked with policies targeted at mode shift away from private motorized transport (such as urban car restraint and parking pricing, car sharing/pooling for travel to work, integrating bike sharing into public transport system) may be needed to achieve the substantial CO2 savings needed to meet climate change mitigation and energy security goals.

There is a growing argument that synergistic approaches to adaptation and mitigation could bring substantial benefits at multiple scales in the land use sector. Nonetheless, efforts to implement synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures are rare due to the weak conceptual framing of the approach and constraining policy issues. In this paper, we explore the attributes of synergy and the necessary enabling conditions and discuss, as an example, experience with the Ngitili system in Tanzania that serves both adaptation and mitigation functions. An in-depth look into the current practices suggests that more emphasis is laid on complementarity-i.e., mitigation projects providing adaptation co-benefits and vice versa rather than on synergy. Unlike complementarity, synergy should emphasize functionally sustainable landscape systems in which adaptation and mitigation are optimized as part of multiple functions. We argue that the current practice of seeking co-benefits (complementarity) is a necessary but insufficient step toward addressing synergy. Moving forward from complementarity will require a paradigm shift from current compartmentalization between mitigation and adaptation to systems thinking at landscape scale. However, enabling policy, institutional, and investment conditions need to be developed at global, national, and local levels to achieve synergistic goals.									41	0	0	12	1	42	1	54	0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000340538100004	25047275	J	Bohnengel, Barrett; Patino-Echeverri, Dalia; Bergerson, Joule								Environmental Implications of United States Coal Exports: A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Future Power System Scenarios								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				48	16			9908	9916		10.1021/es5015828				AUG 19 2014	2014	Stricter emissions requirements on coal-fired power plants together with low natural gas prices have contributed to a recent decline in the use of coal for electricity generation in the United States. Faced with a shrinking domestic market, many coal companies are taking advantage of a growing coal export market. As a result, U.S. coal exports hit an all-time high in 2012, fueled largely by demand in Asia. This paper presents a comparative life cycle assessment of two scenarios: a baseline scenario in which coal continues to be burned domestically for power generation, and an export scenario in which coal is exported to Asia. For the coal export scenario we focus on the Morrow Pacific export project being planned in Oregon by Ambre Energy that would ship 8.8 million tons of Powder River Basin (PRB) coal annually to Asian markets via rail, river barge, and ocean vessel. Air emissions (SOx, NOx, PM10, and CO(2)e) results assuming that the exported coal is burned for electricity generation in South Korea are compared to those of a business as usual case in which Oregon and Washington's coal plants, Boardman and Centralia, are retrofitted to comply with EPA emissions standards and continue their coal consumption. Findings show that although the environmental impacts of shipping PRB coal to Asia are significant, the combination of superior energy efficiency among newer South Korean coal-fired power plants and lower emissions from U.S. replacement of coal with natural gas could lead to a greenhouse gas reduction of 21% in the case that imported PRB coal replaces other coal sources in this Asian country. If instead PRB coal were to replace natural gas or nuclear generation in South Korea, greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated would increase. Results are similar for other air emissions such as SOx, NOx and PM. This study provides a framework for comparing energy export scenarios and highlights the importance of complete life cycle assessment in determining net emissions effects resulting from energy export projects and related policy decisions.									6	0	0	3	0	6	2	54	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000340701800116	25025127	J	Peng, Xianzhi; Ou, Weihui; Wang, Chunwei; Wang, Zhifang; Huang, Qiuxin; Jin, Jiabin; Tan, Jianhua								Occurrence and ecological potential of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in groundwater and reservoirs in the vicinity of municipal landfills in China								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				490				889	898		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.05.068				AUG 15 2014	2014	Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), including antibiotics, azole anti-fungals, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, parabens, antiseptics, and bisphenol A, were investigated in groundwater and reservoirs in the vicinity of two municipal landfills in the metropolis of Guangzhou, South China. Dehydroerythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, fluconazole, salicylic acid, methylparaben, triclosan, and bisphenol A were the mostly frequently detected PPCPs in the groundwater at low ng L-1 levels. In the reservoirs, the PPCPs were widely detected at higher frequencies and concentrations, especially sulfamethoxazole, propiconazole, and ibuprofen, with maximal concentrations above 1 mu g L-1. The PPCPs in the groundwater did not show significant seasonal differences or spatial trends. However, in the reservoirs, higher PPCP concentrations were observed in spring than in other seasons. The anti-bacterials in the groundwater posed medium risks to algae. In the reservoirs, the sulfonamides and macrolides posed low to high risks, while ibuprofen, salicylic acid, and clofibric acid presented low to medium risks to aquatic organisms. Overall, the results showed that the PPCP contaminants and subsequent ecological risks in the groundwater and surface water in the vicinity of the landfills may be of serious concern. More research is needed to better correlate the landfill leachates and PPCP contamination in the nearby aquatic environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Gender consideration in REDD+ is especially important in mountainous countries like Nepal, where the majority of the rural population, especially women and socioeconomically disadvantaged households, depend on forests for many of their subsistence needs. Any changes in forest access or use rights or rules as a result of REDD+ would impact marginalized people whose inclusion, voice, and access to and control over forest resources are influenced by deeply gendered power relations and socio-institutional practices in Nepali society. This article analyzes ways the REDD+ initiatives in Nepal have considered gender issues identified in earlier studies. The main finding is that the REDD+ policy process is inadequate to account for underlying power dynamics, and thus is unable to achieve equity goals. In the absence of accounting for power, the consideration of gender issues in forest management by explicit inclusion of women in the payment criteria and policy discussions within REDD+ programs, including the REDD+ payment pilot project, is insufficient to redress gender imbalances. Forest actors such as the government and other project implementers-including community institutions-lack strategies and responsibilities for applying REDD+ initiatives that are gender equitable and ensure REDD+ benefits and decision-making opportunities for women and other marginalized people. To tap the potential of REDD+ to contribute to both climate change mitigation and mountain development, efforts are needed to make REDD+ national strategy-and policy-making gender sensitive. The critical areas to be addressed in Nepal include framing the REDD+ strategy within the forest ministry's Gender and Social Inclusion Strategy 2008, and then by judicious implementation ensuring access of poor and disadvantaged women and men to forest resources, carbon funds, and decision-making roles in order to undermine entrenched unequal relations.									23	0	0	8	0	23	0	44	0276-4741	1994-7151		WOS:000342674300002		J	Abayomi, A.; Cowan, M.

The HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa: Convergence with tuberculosis, socioecological vulnerability, and climate change patterns								SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL				104	8			583	+		10.7196/SAMJ.8645				AUG 2014	2014	Recent assessment reports suggest that climate change patterns are threatening social and ecological vulnerability and resilience, with the strong potential of negatively affecting human health. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have weakened physiological responses and are immunologically vulnerable to pathogens and stressors in their environment, putting them at a health disadvantage in climate-based rising temperatures, water scarcity, air pollution, potential water-and vector-borne disease outbreaks, and habitat redistributions. These climatic aberrations may lead to increased surface drying and decreased availability of arable land, threatening food/nutrition security and sanitary water practices. Coupled with HIV/AIDS, climate change threatens ecological biodiversity via a larger-scale socioeconomic recourse to natural resources. Corresponding human and environmental activity shape conditions conducive to exacerbating high rates of HIV/AIDS. In South Africa, this epidemic is forming a 'syndemic' with tuberculosis (TB), which has come to include multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) strains. Because of high convergence rates, one epidemic cannot be addressed without understanding the other. Concurrent climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are becoming increasingly important to curb changes that negatively affect the biospheres on which civilisation is ultimately dependent - from an agricultural, a developmental, and especially a health standpoint. Mitigation strategies such as reducing carbon emissions are essential, but may be only partially effective in slowing the rate of surface warming. However, global climate assessments assert that these are not sufficient to halt climate change patterns. The roles of regionally specific climate research, socioecologically sustainable industrialisation paths for developing countries, and adoption of health system strengthening strategies are therefore vital.									7	0	0	3	2	7	1	37	0256-9574	2078-5135		WOS:000341986000029	26307805	J	Bowles, D.

Socially, politically and economically mediated ('tertiary') effects will probably be the most significant consequences of climate change, substantially exceeding the probable burden of its direct effects and infectious diseases. Climate change will decrease crop yields in many low-latitude areas, decreasing food security in many countries, including those in Africa. Under-nutrition will worsen, aggravated by diminished economic growth - one of the most widely predicted consequences of climate change. Furthermore, migration will increase, which will stretch and could even overwhelm health systems in destination areas, in addition to sapping donor locations of the financial and human capital they could use for further development. Mass migration heightens the risk of conflict, as does resource scarcity caused by climate change. Consequently, the capacity of states to meet the expectations of their citizens and impose law and order could further decrease, incentivising unscrupulous leaders to initiate or sustain conflict to enhance their support base. In summary, health systems on the African continent will be severely challenged by the increased demands caused by climate change, while their capacity will be diminished by its direct effects, reduced economic growth, additional migration and conflict. Adaptation is frequently treated as the best climate change response, but it is especially difficult in poorer countries, where even general development is threatened by these challenges. Reliance on adaptation would exacerbate the health gap. Global climate change mitigation is the surest way to preserve health, in Africa and elsewhere.									3	0	0	2	1	3	0	31	0256-9574	2078-5135		WOS:000341986000031	26307807	J	Degen, C.; Kettner, S.

It is generally assumed that information status and comprehension of complex processes underlying climate change are prerequisites for adopting pro-environmental attitudes and taking pro-environmental actions. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated in how far (1) environmental knowledge and comprehension of feedback processes underlying climate change and (2) pro-environmental attitudes change as a function of age. Our sample consisted of 92 participants aged 25-75 years (mean age 49.4 years, SD 17.0). Age was negatively related to comprehension of system structures inherent to climate change, but positively associated with level of fear of consequences and anxiousness towards climate change. No significant relations were found between environmental knowledge and pro-environmental attitude. These results indicate that, albeit understanding of relevant structures of the climate system is less present in older age, age is not a limiting factor for being engaged in the complex dilemma of climate change. Results bear implications for the communication of climate change and pro-environmental actions in aging societies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	10	0948-6704	1435-1269		WOS:000341500700006	25119704	J	Simonson, William D.; Allen, Harriet D.; Coomes, David A.

Habitat structure is important in explaining species diversity patterns for many animal groups. If we could map habitat structure over large spatial scales, we could use habitat structure-species diversity (HS-SD) relationships to model species diversity and inform conservation planning and management. Traditional approaches for measuring habitat structure cannot be applied over entire landscapes, but remote sensing tools are now able to overcome this limitation. Here, we explore the potential of airborne lidar for the assessment and monitoring of animal species diversity in terrestrial environments.2. We review the habitat attributes commonly recorded in the study of HS-SD relationships and the spatial scale of their measurement, in papers published between 1960 and 2013. We also gather evidence for the use of lidar to make relevant measurements at similar scales.3. Eight out of 15 attributes of habitat structure commonly used in published studies relate to the vertical dimension of habitat. The core strength of lidar is that it is a vertical profiler, and this technology can be used to derive estimates of all but one of these structural attributes. Lidar can also be used to improve the measurement of the four commonly used attributes focusing on the horizontal heterogeneity of habitat patches. The spatial grain and extent of HS-SD studies is usually within the operational capability of airborne lidar; when a vertical measure of habitat structure has been employed, this is true in 84% of published studies. The potential efficacy of lidar in this field of biodiversity studies is underlined by several published examples of lidar modelling of animal species diversity.4. We conclude that lidar remote sensing is fit for the purpose of biodiversity assessment and monitoring through its ability to characterize habitat structure, a key driver of animal species diversity, over large spatial scales. We advocate wider application of lidar-based HS-SD indicators to help tackle the current biodiversity crisis. In combination with other remote sensing products, these indicators may support the implementation and monitoring of environmental legislation, inform gap analyses and the planning of management actions for protected areas and species, and drive greater synergy with forest-based climate change mitigation.									40	2	0	31	0	42	0	119	2041-210X	2041-2096		WOS:000340600400001		J	Powlson, David S.; Stirling, Clare M.; Jat, M.

But these claims ignore a large body of experimental evidence showing that the quantity of additional organic carbon in soil under no-till is relatively small: in large part apparent increases result from an altered depth distribution. The larger concentration near the surface in no-till is generally beneficial for soil properties that often, though not always, translate into improved crop growth. In many regions where no-till is practised it is common for soil to be cultivated conventionally every few years for a range of agronomic reasons, so any soil carbon benefit is then lost. We argue that no-till is beneficial for soil quality and adaptation of agriculture to climate change, but its role in mitigation is widely overstated.									233	7	0	154	3	238	24	308	1758-678X	1758-6798		WOS:000341568200019		J	Krey, Volker					Krey, Volker/0000-0003-0307-3515			Global energy-climate scenarios and models: a review								WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT				3	4			363	383		10.1002/wene.98				JUL-AUG 2014	2014	Long-term energy scenarios are an important input to policy-relevant assessment reports on climate change such as those produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the United Nations Environment Programme to just name a few examples. They are also used by government agencies to support their decision making in the context of climate change mitigation and other energy-related challenges. In response to this demand, two broader categories of model development are currently pursued by the scientific community: (1) the degree of integration is increasing, in other words, the system boundaries of models are being extended, in particular to address the interlinkages between the energy, land, food, water, and climate more comprehensively and (2) the heterogeneity of the representation of various entities (e.g., spatial, sectoral, socio-economic) is increasing to adequately address distributional effects (e.g., countries within regions, urban vs rural areas, different types of households). Moreover, the energy-climate scenarios that are being developed are designed to be more 'realistic' by going beyond very stylized designs and integrate features that are observed in the real world. This includes delayed action on climate mitigation or fragmented approaches to mitigation that not only exclude major emitters from climate action, but also the exclusion of specific technologies from the portfolio of mitigation options in response to technical challenges or public acceptance issues. Finally, an attempt is made to summarize robust insights that have emerged from individual studies and particularly from modeling comparison exercises.

These pollutants, many of which are generated through various anthropogenic activities, are being increasingly scrutinized by regulatory authorities. Regulation of emissions from livestock production systems will ultimately increase on farm costs, which will then be passed onto consumers. Therefore, it is essential that scientifically based emission factors are developed for on-farm emissions of air quality constituents to improve inventories and assign appropriate reduction targets. To generate a larger database of on-farm emissions, the USDA-ARS created the workgroup Livestock GRACEnet (Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement Network). This introduction for the special section of papers highlights some of the research presently being conducted by members of Livestock GRACEnet with the intent of drawing attention to critical information gaps, such as (i) improving emissions measurements; (ii) developing emissions factors; (iii) developing and validating tools for estimating emissions; and (iv) mitigating emissions. We also provide a synthesis of the literature with respect to key research areas related to livestock emissions, including feeding strategies, animal housing, manure management, and manure land application, and discuss future research priorities and directions.									7	0	0	4	0	7	0	33	0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000339273000001	25603058	J	Bui, Thuyet D.; Maier, Stefan W.; Austin, Chris M.

Of special concern is the loss of mangrove forest in coastal areas such as Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which is adjacent to the World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay. Understanding the status and changes of land cover/land use for coastal shrimp farms and mangrove forests can support environmental protection and decision-making for sustainable development in coastal areas. Within this context, this paper uses the 1999/2001 Landsat ETM+ and the 2008 ALOS AVNIR-2 imagery to investigate the contraction and expansion of shrimp farms and mangrove forests in coastal areas of Ha Long and Mong Cai, which now have a high concentration of intensive and semi-intensive shrimp farms. Images were separately analyzed and classified before using post-classification comparisons to detect land cover/land use changes in the study area. The results of this study found that the area of mangrove forest has been reduced by an estimated 927.5 ha in Ha Long and 1,144.4 ha in Mong Cai, while shrimp farming areas increased by an estimated 1,195.9 and 1,702.5 ha, respectively, over the same period. The majority of shrimp farms in Mong Cai were established at the expense of mangrove forest (49.4 %) while shrimp farms in Ha Long were mainly constructed on areas previously occupied by bare ground (46.5 %) and a significant proportion also replaced mangroves (23.9 %). The remarkable rate of mangrove loss and shrimp farming expansion detected in this study, over a relatively short time scale indicate that greater awareness of environmental impacts of shrimp farm expansion is required if this industry is to be sustainable, the important estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems are to be protected over the long term, and the capturing and storing of carbon in mangrove systems are to be enhanced for global climate change mitigation and for use as carbon offsets.									10	3	0	5	0	13	6	62	1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000338324700012		J	Soret, Samuel; Mejia, Alfredo; Batech, Michael; Jaceldo-Siegl, Karen; Harwatt, Helen; Sabate, Joan					Batech, Michael/0000-0001-9570-8180			Climate change mitigation and health effects of varied dietary patterns in real-life settings throughout North America								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION				100	1			490S	495S		10.3945/ajcn.113.071589			S	JUL 2014	2014	Background: Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are a major consequence of our dietary choices. Assessments of plant-based compared with meat-based diets are emerging at the intersection of public health, environment, and nutrition.Objectives: The objective was to compare the GHGEs associated with dietary patterns consumed in a large population across North America and to independently assess mortality according to dietary patterns in the same population.Design: Data from the Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2) were used to characterize the differential environmental and health impacts of the following 3 dietary patterns, which varied in the quantity of animal and plant foods: vegetarian, semivegetarian, and nonvegetarian. The GHGE intensities of 210 foods were calculated through life-cycle assessments and by using published data. The all-cause mortality rates and all-cause mortality HRs for the AHS-2 subjects were adjusted for a range of lifestyle and sociodemographic factors and estimated according to dietary pattern.Results: With the use of the nonvegetarian diet as a reference, the mean reductions in GHGEs for semivegetarian and vegetarian diets were 22% and 29%, respectively. The mortality rates for nonvegetarians, semivegetarians, and vegetarians were 6.66, 5.53, and 5.56 deaths per 1000 person-years, respectively. The differences were significant. Compared with nonvegetarians, mortality HRs were lower for semivegetarians (0.86) and vegetarians (0.91).Conclusions: Moderate differences in the caloric intake of meat products provided nontrivial reductions in GHGEs and improved health outcomes, as shown through the mortality analyses. However, this does not mean that diets lower in GHGEs are healthy.					6th International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition (ICVN)6th International Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition (ICVN)	FEB 24-26, 2013FEB 24-26, 2013	Loma Linda Univ Hlth; Kelloggs; Calif Walnut Commiss; Silk; Lifestyle Med Inst Sanitarium Hlth & Wellbeing; LifeLong Hlth; Int Nut & Dried Fruit CouncilLoma Linda Univ Hlth; Kelloggs; Calif Walnut Commiss; Silk; Lifestyle Med Inst Sanitarium Hlth & Wellbeing; LifeLong Hlth; Int Nut & Dried Fruit Council	Loma Linda Univ, Loma Linda, CALoma Linda Univ, Loma Linda, CA	52	0	0	20	0	52	2	83	0002-9165	1938-3207		WOS:000337862200027	24898230	J	Agbota, Henoc								Anticipating the Unintended Consequences of the Decarbonisation of the Historic Built Environment in the UK								HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT-POLICY & PRACTICE				5	2			101	115		10.1179/1756750514Z.00000000049				JUL 2014	2014	The historic built environment in the UK is expected to contribute to the national commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. The related major changes in policies and regulations inevitably are leading to unintended consequences which need to be accounted for. This paper reviews the unintended consequences of decarbonisation policies for the historic built environment in the UK, as reported in the literature. The review highlights some unintended consequences that certain carbon-reduction- driven building interventions could have for the fabric of historic buildings. The review also reports on concerns that other building interventions - for example, the installation of renewable micro-generation energy sources - can negatively and significantly impact the aesthetics and significance of historic buildings. Finally, the review also shows that there is little anticipation of the consequences of decarbonisation policies for the conservation of collections, occupants' health, comfort, and behaviour, and wider society in general.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	16	1756-7505	1756-7513		WOS:000338773000003		J	Keith, Heather; Lindenmayer, David; Mackey, Brendan; Blair, David; Carter, Lauren; McBurney, Lachlan; Okada, Sachiko; Konishi-Nagano, Tomoko				Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017	Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088; Mackey, Brendan/0000-0003-1996-4064			Managing temperate forests for carbon storage: impacts of logging versus forest protection on carbon stocks								ECOSPHERE				5	6					75	10.1890/ES14-00051.1				JUN 2014	2014	Management of native forests offers opportunities to store more carbon in the land sector through two main activities. Emissions to the atmosphere can be avoided by ceasing logging. Removals of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can be increased by allowing forests to continue growing. However, the relative benefits for carbon storage of managing native forests for wood production versus protection are contested. Additionally, the potential for carbon storage is impacted upon by disturbance events, such as wildfire, that alter the amount and longevity of carbon stocks.Using a case study of montane ash forests in southeastern Australia, we demonstrated that the total biomass carbon stock in logged forest was 55% of the stock in old growth forest. Total biomass included above-and belowground, living and dead. Biomass carbon stock was calculated spatially as an average across the landscape, accounting for variation in environmental conditions and forest age distribution. Reduction in carbon stock in logged forest was due to 66% of the initial biomass being made into products with short lifetimes (<3 years), and to the lower average age of logged forest (, 50 years compared with >100 years in old growth forest). Only 4% of the initial carbon stock in the native forest was converted to sawn timber products with lifetimes of 30-90 years.Carbon stocks are depleted in a harvested forest system compared with an old growth forest, even when storage in wood products and landfill are included. We estimated that continued logging under current plans represented a loss of 5.56 Tg C over 5 years in the area logged (824 km(2)), compared with a potential gain of 5.18-6.05 TgC over 5 years by allowing continued growth across the montane ash forest region (2326 km(2)). Avoiding emissions by not logging native forests and allowing them to continue growing is therefore an important form of carbon sequestration. The mitigation value of forest management options of protection versus logging should be assessed in terms of the amount, longevity and resilience of the carbon stored in the forest, rather than the annual rate of carbon uptake.									39	7	0	28	0	49	1	75	2150-8925			WOS:000338925000009		J	Wolf, Tanja; Martinez, Gerardo Sanchez; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Williams, Eloise; Menne, Bettina					Sanchez Martinez, Gerardo/0000-0002-3290-6195; Cheong, Hae-Kwan/0000-0003-2758-9399			Protecting Health from Climate Change in the WHO European Region								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				11	6			6265	6280		10.3390/ijerph110606265				JUN 2014	2014	"How far are we in the WHO European Region in implementing action to counter the health impacts of climate change?" This was the question posed to representatives of Member States in the WHO European Region of in the WHO working group on health in climate change (HIC). Twenty-two Member States provided answers to a comprehensive 2012 questionnaire that focused on eight thematic areas (governance vulnerability, impact and adaptation (health) assessments (VIA); adaptation strategies and action plans; climate change mitigation; strengthening health systems; raising awareness and building capacity; greening health services; and sharing best practices). Strong development has been in climate change vulnerability and impact assessments, as well as strengthening health systems and awareness raising. Areas where implementation would benefit from further action are the development of national health adaptation plans, greening health systems, sharing best practices and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in other sectors. At the Fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in Parma, Italy in 2010, the European Commitment to Act on climate change and health and the European Regional Framework for Action to protect health from climate change were endorsed by the fifty-three European Member States. The results of this questionnaire present the most comprehensive assessment so far of progress made by European Member States to protect public health from climate change since the Parma Conference agreements.									11	0	0	2	0	11	0	13	1660-4601			WOS:000338662600045	24937528	J	Haus, S.; Gustavsson, L.; Sathre, R.								Climate mitigation comparison of woody biomass systems with the inclusion of land-use in the reference fossil system								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				65				136	144		10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.04.012				JUN 2014	2014	While issues of land-use have been considered in many direct analyses of biomass systems, little attention has heretofore been paid to land-use in reference fossil systems. Here we address this limitation by comparing forest biomass systems to reference fossil systems with explicit consideration of land-use in both systems. We estimate and compare the time profiles of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) of woody biomass systems and reference fossil systems. A life cycle perspective is used that includes all significant elements of both systems, including GHG emissions along the full material and energy chains. We consider the growth dynamics of forests under different management regimes, as well as energy and material substitution effects of harvested biomass. We determine the annual net emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 for each system over a 240-year period, and then calculate time profiles of cRF as a proxy measurement of climate change impact. The results show greatest potential for climate change mitigation when intensive forest management is applied in the woody biomass system. This methodological framework provides a tool to help determine optimal strategies for managing forests so as to minimize climate change impacts. The inclusion of land-use in the reference system improves the accuracy of quantitative projections of climate benefits of biomass-based systems. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The amount of energy consumed by indoor heating and air conditioning is affected by T-a. The value of MRT is the sum of all short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes absorbed by the human body that affects its energy balance and human thermal comfort. SVF in urban areas affects both T-a and MRT. We used a microscale urban climate model (ENVI-met) and simulated the effect of building geometry in four typical urban districts (each 300 x 300 m(2) in size) in Montreal, on air and human weighted mean radiant temperature (MRThuman (weighted)) at 1.5-m height above the ground. Urban development consideration of a low SVF could mitigate the UHI effect, by decreasing urban temperatures and increasing outdoor thermal comfort. Most UHI studies are carried out for cities in hot and dry climates; however, UHI mitigation can also reduce energy consumption in colder cities, such as Montreal. Results of this analysis can be used in environmental urban planning standards.									16	1	0	2	1	18	4	64	1092-8758	1557-9018		WOS:000337911000002		J	Sacchi, Simona; Riva, Paolo; Brambilla, Marco; Grasso, Marco				Brambilla, Marco/I-9342-2018; Riva, Paolo/D-8130-2011	Brambilla, Marco/0000-0002-4774-3309; Riva, Paolo/0000-0002-9855-994X; Grasso, Marco/0000-0002-6869-5959			Moral reasoning and climate change mitigation: The deontological reaction toward the market-based approach								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				38				252	261		10.1016/j.jenvp.2014.03.001				JUN 2014	2014	The research investigated the relation between the individual's deontological stance about environment and the attitude toward a market-based approach to climate change mitigation. We introduced people to the cap-and-trade program which is expected both to reduce the environmental risk and maximize economic benefits. Study I showed that the stronger the deontological mandate people held toward nature, the more likely they were to refuse the cap-and-trade mitigation program regardless of its effectiveness. In Study 2 and in Study 3, a similar win win scenario was adopted to explore whether deontology and consequentialism consist of mutually exclusive orientations. Our results revealed that the deontological approach per se did not preclude the use of the cost benefit analysis and that consequentialism moderated the relationship between deontology and the attitude toward the cap-andtrade program. Taken together, our findings have relevant practical implications for environmental politics and contribute to theoretical insights into moral reasoning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years the spectre of global warming and ocean acidification, which has been primarily attributed to fossil fuel burning, has brought renewable energy at the forefront of most climate change mitigation strategies. There is strong advocacy for large-scale substitution of conventional energy sources with the renewables on the premise that such a move would substantially reduce environmental degradation and global warming. These sentiments are being echoed by scientists and policy makers as well as environmental activists all over the world.'Small hydro', which generally represents hydroelectric power projects of capacities 25 MW or lower, is one of the renewable energy options which is believed to be clean and sustainable even as its bigger version, large hydro, is known to cause several strongly adverse environmental impacts.This paper brings out that the prevailing perception of 'eco-friendliness' of small hydro is mainly due to the fact that it has only been used to a very small extent so far. But once it is deployed at a scale comparable to fossil fuel use, the resulting impacts would be quite substantially adverse.The purpose is not to denegrade small hydro, less so to advocate use of fossil fuels. It, rather, is to bring home the point that a much more realistic and elaborate assessment of the likely direct as well as indirect impacts of extensive utilization of this energy source than has been done hitherto is necessary.

Studies of such co-benefits and co-harms involve modeling approaches requiring a range of analytic decisions that affect the model output.Objective: Our objective was to assess analytic decisions regarding model framework, structure, choice of parameters, and handling of uncertainty when modeling health co-benefits, and to make recommendations for improvements that could increase policy uptake.Methods: We describe the assumptions and analytic decisions underlying models of mitigation co-benefits, examining their effects on modeling outputs, and consider tools for quantifying uncertainty.Discussion: There is considerable variation in approaches to valuation metrics, discounting methods, uncertainty characterization and propagation, and assessment of low-probability/high-impact events. There is also variable inclusion of adverse impacts of mitigation policies, and limited extension of modeling domains to include implementation considerations. Going forward, co-benefits modeling efforts should be carried out in collaboration with policy makers; these efforts should include the full range of positive and negative impacts and critical uncertainties, as well as a range of discount rates, and should explicitly characterize uncertainty. We make recommendations to improve the rigor and consistency of modeling of health co-benefits.Conclusion: Modeling health co-benefits requires systematic consideration of the suitability of model assumptions, of what should be included and excluded from the model framework, and how uncertainty should be treated. Increased attention to these and other analytic decisions has the potential to increase the policy relevance and application of co-benefits modeling studies, potentially helping policy makers to maximize mitigation potential while simultaneously improving health.									22	0	0	6	0	22	1	37	0091-6765	1552-9924		WOS:000337606300013	24583270	J	Gampfer, Robert								Do individuals care about fairness in burden sharing for climate change mitigation?

Normative theory suggests various fairness criteria for structuring burden sharing, most prominently, historical responsibility for emissions, economic capacity, and vulnerability to climate change. Governments have taken up these criteria in their rhetoric at UNFCCC negotiations. I examine whether normative criteria influence individual burden sharing preferences. This bottom-up perspective is important for two reasons. First, it is unknown if governments' fairness rhetoric matches citizens' actual preferences. Second, international climate agreements directly affect individuals through domestic policy measures (e.g. energy taxes), and therefore require domestic public support for successful implementation. I conducted two laboratory experiments where participants have to agree on how to share climate change mitigation costs in an ultimatum game. Treatment conditions include differences between proposer and responder in capacity, vulnerability (experiment 1), and historical emissions (experiment 2). Historical emissions are endogenously determined in a prior game. Capacity inequality strongly affects burden sharing, with richer players ending up paying more, and poorer players less. Vulnerability differences reduce the influence of fairness, leading to suggested cost distributions more unfavorable to vulnerable players. However, vulnerable responders still reject many "unfair" offers. Differences in historical responsibility result in cost distributions strongly correlated with players' relative contributions to climate change. The results suggest that more nuanced consideration of fairness criteria in burden sharing could make ambitious climate agreements more acceptable for reluctant countries and their citizens.									15	0	0	3	0	15	1	34	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000336365300006		J	Sorrentino, Marco; Rizzo, Gianfranco; Sorrentino, Luca				Sorrentino, Marco/Y-3847-2019				A study aimed at assessing the potential impact of vehicle electrification on grid infrastructure and road-traffic green house emissions								APPLIED ENERGY				120				31	40		10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.01.040				MAY 1 2014	2014	In the current paper a thorough analysis is conducted to assess, on one hand, the impact of vehicle electrification on electric grids and their related infrastructures, and, on the other, its potential contribution to GHG emission reduction.

The expected time evolution of both PHEV and BEV private car fleets is modeled through a simplified market penetration model, along with the associated contribution in terms of well to tank and tank to wheel GHG emissions, thus providing the needed input data to the scenario analysis. Particularly, a longitudinal vehicle model is adopted to accurately estimate electric vehicle energy consumptions and related GHG emissions as a function of powertrain configuration, dimensions and mass.The analysis was run on several countries, thus providing useful outcomes to assess the suitability of given energy mix to fully exploit vehicle electrification. Such indications will therefore be useful to determine to which extent progressive decarbonization of current grids is required to meet the GHG reduction target by 2050. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This essay outlines an agenda for critical climate history-asserting that it is critical for environmental historians to be more involved today and that they ought to be more critical of climate change discourse, policies, and scientific modeling of climate scenarios and the data that nourish those models. Using a case study from the Peruvian Andes and briefly describing parallel situations in the Himalaya and US Pacific Northwest, the essay shows that climate-glacier-hydrology models are inadequate and can even be misleading without the integration of historical human variables. Environmental historians are well poised to analyze and contribute to climate modeling that brings together science/knowledge, the physical environment, and societal forces. Moreover, a goal of critical climate history is to inject historical perspectives into present-day climate science and policy to help rethink the hegemony of climate science, to question the dominant climate discourse and framing, and to critique mainstream approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This Forum on climate change and environmental history illustrates on a broader scale both the contributions and the unfulfilled opportunities for future scholarship in critical climate history.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	13	1084-5453	1930-8892		WOS:000339951500015		J	Macmillan, Alexandra; Connor, Jennie; Witten, Karen; Kearns, Robin; Rees, David; Woodward, Alistair					Connor, Jennie/0000-0002-3209-8693; Woodward, Alistair/0000-0001-5425-6018; Macmillan, Alexandra/0000-0001-8070-3280			The Societal Costs and Benefits of Commuter Bicycling: Simulating the Effects of Specific Policies Using System Dynamics Modeling								ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES				122	4			335	344		10.1289/ehp.1307250				APR 2014	2014	BACKGROUND: Shifting to active modes of transport in the trip to work can achieve substantial co-benefits for health, social equity, and climate change mitigation. Previous integrated modeling of transport scenarios has assumed active transport mode share and has been unable to incorporate acknowledged system feedbacks.OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of policies to increase bicycle commuting in a car-dominated city and explored the role of participatory modeling to support transport planning in the face of complexity.METHODS: We used system dynamics modeling (SDM) to compare realistic policies, incorporating feedback effects, nonlinear relationships, and time delays between variables. We developed a system dynamics model of commuter bicycling through interviews and workshops with policy, community, and academic stakeholders. We incorporated best available evidence to simulate five policy scenarios over the next 40 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Injury, physical activity, fuel costs, air pollution, and carbon emissions outcomes were simulated.RESULTS: Using the simulation model, we demonstrated the kinds of policies that would likely be needed to change a historical pattern of decline in cycling into a pattern of growth that would meet policy goals. Our model projections suggest that transforming urban roads over the next 40 years, using best practice physical separation on main roads and bicycle-friendly speed reduction on local streets, would yield benefits 10-25 times greater than costs.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first integrated simulation model of future specific bicycling policies. Our projections provide practical evidence that may be used by health and transport policy makers to optimize the benefits of transport bicycling while minimizing negative consequences in a cost-effective manner. The modeling process enhanced understanding by a range of stakeholders of cycling as a complex system. Participatory SDM can be a helpful method for integrating health and environmental outcomes in transport and urban planning.									67	2	0	15	0	69	3	103	0091-6765	1552-9924		WOS:000334069100015	24496244	J	d'Orey, Pedro M.; Ferreira, Michel				d'Orey, Pedro/O-9257-2019; M. d'Orey, Pedro/A-5262-2013	d'Orey, Pedro/0000-0002-2017-808X; M. d'Orey, Pedro/0000-0002-2017-808X; Ferreira, Michel/0000-0003-0357-6470			ITS for Sustainable Mobility: A Survey on Applications and Impact Assessment Tools								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				15	2			477	493		10.1109/TITS.2013.2287257				APR 2014	2014	Road transportation is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which lead to global warming and climate change. Promoting the decarbonization of this sector through more efficient and greener mobility is a challenging task that can be achieved by intelligent transportation systems (ITS) enabled by vehicular communications. In this paper, we briefly present how mobility players and enablers (driver, vehicle, and road network) influence energy consumption and pollutant emissions. Furthermore, this survey paper details how different ITS, ranging from eco-routing to intelligent intersection management, can lead to sustainable mobility by promoting a more efficient vehicle usage and enhanced efficiency on road network utilization. Results shown that ITS has the potential to considerably reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, namely, by smoothing the traffic flow, reducing the number of start-stops, and reducing the total travel distance. In addition, we present and analyze two main methods for evaluating green transportation systems: 1) field operational tests; and 2) simulation-based evaluations. We give special emphasis to simulation-based assessment of Green ITS measures by detailing the necessary models and their interactions. Finally, we propose a number of recommendations and future research directions in the area of Green ITS.									32	0	0	0	0	32	3	64	1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000334584800003		J	Popp, J.; Lakner, Z.; Harangi-Rakos, M.; Fari, M.

Given the increasing land requirement for biofuel production, the assessment of the impacts that extensive biofuel production may cause to food supply and to the environment has considerable importance. Agriculture faces some major inter-connected challenges in delivering food security at a time of increasing pressures from population growth, changing consumption patterns and dietary preferences, and post-harvest losses. At the same time, there are growing opportunities and demands for the use of biomass to provide additional renewables, energy for heat, power and fuel, pharmaceuticals and green chemical feedstocks. Biomass from cellulosic bioenergy crops is expected to play a substantial role in future energy systems. However, the worldwide potential of bioenergy is limited, because all land is multi-functional and land is also needed for food, feed, timber, and fiber production, and for nature conservation and climate protection. Furthermore, the potential of bioenergy for climate change mitigation remains unclear due to large uncertainties about future agricultural yield improvements and land availability for biomass plantations. Large-scale cultivation of dedicated biomass is likely to affect bioenergy potentials, global food prices and water scarcity. Therefore, integrated policies far energy, land use and water management are needed. As biomass contains all the elements found in fossil resources, albeit in different combinations, therefore present and developing technologies can lead to a future based on renewable, sustainable and low carbon economies. This article presents [1] risks to food and energy security [2] estimates of bioenergy potential with regard to biofuel production, and [3] the challenges of the environmental impact.

Mitigation of the associated GHG emissions is vital and should be considered within integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) management planning. In this study, a fuzzy possibilistic integer programming (FPIM) model has been developed for waste management facility expansion and waste flow allocation planning with consideration of GHG emission trading in an MSW management system. It can address the interrelationships between MSW management planning and GHG emission control. The scenario of total system GHG emission control is analyzed for reflecting the feature that GHG emission credits may be tradable. An interactive solution algorithm is used to solve the FPIM model based on the uncertainty-averse preferences of decision makers in terms of p-necessity level, which represents the certainty degree of the imprecise objective. The FPIM model has been applied to a hypothetical MSW planning problem, where optimal decision schemes for facility expansion and waste flow allocation have been achieved with consideration of GHG emission control. The results indicate that GHG emission credit trading can decrease total system cost through re-allocation of GHG emission credits within the entire MSW management system. This will be helpful for decision makers to effectively determine the allowable GHG emission permits in practices. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, forest governance is weak in most REDD+ countries, which undermines efforts to establish REDD+. This study analyses the factors that enable national REDD+ processes in the context of weak governance using a two-step qualitative comparative analysis' (QCA) of 12 REDD+ countries. Assuming that actor-related factors can be effective only if certain institutional preconditions are met, six factors were divided into two categories that were analysed separately: institutional setting (pressure from forest-resource shortage; forest legislation, policy, and governance; already initiated policy change) and the policy arena (national ownership; transformational coalitions; inclusiveness of the policy process). The factors were analysed to determine their role in efforts to establish comprehensive REDD+ policies that target transformational change. The results reveal path dependencies and institutional stickiness in all the study countries. Only countries already undertaking institutional change have been able to establish REDD+ policies in a relatively short period - but only in the presence of either high pressure from forest-resource shortages or key features of effective forest legislation, policy, and governance. Furthermore, where an enabling institutional setting is in place, the policy arena conditions of national ownership and transformational coalitions are crucial.Policy relevance Although the aim of REDD+ is to provide performance-based payments for emissions reductions, the outcomes in terms of actual emission reductions or co-benefits are not yet observable. Most REDD+ countries are still at the design and implementation stage for policies and measures. Indicators and criteria to measure progress in this phase are required to identify which factors enable or hinder countries' performance in delivering necessary policy change to provide targeted financial incentives to support countries' efforts. This study analyses the factors that shape national REDD+ processes in the context of weak governance using a two-step QCA of 12 REDD+ countries. The results show a set of enabling conditions and characteristics of the policy process under which REDD+ policies can be established. These findings may help guide other countries seeking to formulate REDD+ policies that are likely to deliver efficient, effective, and equitable outcomes.									35	0	0	7	0	35	0	60	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000328670100002		J	Marin, Fabio R.; Ribeiro, Rafael V.; Marchiori, Paulo E.

A case study with sugarcane								THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				26	1			49	63		10.1007/s40626-014-0006-2				MAR 2014	2014	Global climate changes are now well accepted to happen and can likely impact agriculture. Process-based dynamic crop models are able to estimate a range of crop responses to the environment and to assess the biophysical effects of future climate scenarios on crop growth and yield. They are hence scientifically accepted as a predictor of future agricultural scenarios, and the multi-model approach has shown the best performance in such prediction activities. The need of several models for such studies is mainly a consequence of the different physiological and physical approaches applied by model developers. Physiological processes are in fact essential elements for improving plant modeling, and most of the model weakness would be overcome by better understanding of the main physiological aspects related to plant growth and development. Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important crop for coping with climate change mitigation as a source of bioenergy and food. In this paper we aim to demonstrate how important is plant physiology for advancing the process-based crop models by briefly reviewing the history of the modeling along the last five decades and presenting the key physiological process considered in crop models. The paper was based in the DSSAT/CANEGRO sugarcane model and a set of field experiments for exemplifying some model responses to key climatic variables expected to vary in the following decades. Those responses were discussed under the light of plant physiology knowledge. We selected two sites in the State of Sao Paulo for an exercise of local sensitivity analysis. As air CO2 concentration is the most likely environmental variable expected to change, we stressed the CO2 effects on plant photosynthesis and water use to highlight the model strengths and opportunities for model improvements based on plant physiology findings.									11	1	0	6	1	12	2	61	2197-0025			WOS:000341353300005		J	Wang, Tao; Foliente, Greg; Song, Xinyi; Xue, Jiawei; Fang, Dongping				Foliente, Greg/B-9812-2009	Foliente, Greg/0000-0003-1968-4978; SONG, XINYI/0000-0003-1741-4747			Implications and future direction of greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies in the building sector of China								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				31				520	530		10.1016/j.rser.2013.12.023				MAR 2014	2014	A common starting point in assessing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policy implications in the built environment is to look at industry specific policies. This paper addressed the glaring gap between national alleconomy policy options that actually determine industry-specific programs, and their downstream impacts and implications to the building and construction sector. National carbon policy schemes were organised into two basic types: indirect pricing mechanisms, and direct pricing mechanisms. Their features and comparative strengths and limitations were critically reviewed under a common framework, drawing from a wide body of literature. The status of the application of the GHG reduction policies in China was reviewed. A green building case is studied to quantitatively present the effectiveness and deficiencies of the current GHG mitigation policies in the building sector of China, and their implications to a building's life cycle. Based on China's current status of the policy system, this paper identifies the future direction of building's GHG mitigation policies of China. Policies directly aiming to GHG mitigation in the building sector should be implemented in holistic and comprehensive pathway, to balance the costs and benefith of the stakeholders for the promotion of building GHG mitigation technologies.

The site data include latitude, longitude, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, forest type, stand age, BCDa, living biomass (above- and below-ground biomass) carbon density and total (living plus dead) biomass carbon density. Based on the site data, we performed regression analyses to show how BCDa changes with climate and forest stand age.ResultsAt a global scale, the highest BCDa of mature forests occurred mainly in the mid-latitude regions where mean annual temperatures were 8-10 degrees C and mean annual precipitation was between 1000 and 2500mm. The average BCDa of forests in the stand age class of 450-500 years was higher than those in the other stand age classes. For forests between 80 and 450 years old, which form the majority of mature forests, carbon accumulation was faster in dead biomass than in living biomass.Main conclusionsThe highest BCDa of mature forests is located in mid-latitude regions with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. The age threshold for old-growth forests at a global scale should be 450-500 years, which is much older than the previously documented age of 100-200 years. This older age threshold for old-growth forests is probably one of the primary reasons why recent works have concluded that old-growth forests are still carbon sinks.									31	16	0	30	0	45	1	124	1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000331082100007		J	Byers, Edward A.; Hall, Jim W.; Amezaga, Jaime M.

Cooling of thermoelectric plants is often achieved by water abstractions from the natural environment. In England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for approximately half of all water abstractions and 40% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. We present a model that quantifies current water use of the UK electricity sector and use it to test six decarbonisation pathways to 2050. The pathways consist of a variety of generation technologies, with associated cooling methods, water use factors and cooling water sources. We find that up to 2030, water use across the six pathways is fairly consistent and all achieve significant reductions in both carbon and water intensity, based upon a transition to closed loop and hybrid cooling systems. From 2030 to 2050 our results diverge. Pathways with high levels of carbon capture and storage result in freshwater consumption that exceeds current levels (37-107%), and a consumptive intensity that is 30-69% higher. Risks to the aquatic environment will be intensified if generation with carbon capture and storage is clustered. Pathways of high nuclear capacity result in tidal and coastal abstraction that exceed current levels by 148-399%. Whilst reducing freshwater abstractions, the marine environment will be impacted if a shortage of coastal sites leads to clustering of nuclear reactors and concentration of heated water discharges. The pathway with the highest level of renewables has both lowest abstraction and consumption of water. Freshwater consumption can also be minimised through use of hybrid cooling, which despite marginally higher costs and emissions, would reduce dependence on scarce water resources thus increase security of supply. 0 2014 The Authors.

Reducing environmental impacts as WDSs develop is essential for utility managers and policy makers. This study quantifies the existing greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of common WDS elements using life-cycle assessment (LCA) while identifying the greatest opportunities for emission reduction. This study addresses oversights of the related literature, which fails to capture several WDS elements and to provide detailed life-cycle inventories. The life-cycle inventory results for a US case study utility reveal that 81% of GHGs are from pumping energy, where a large portion of these emissions are a result of distribution leaks, which account for 270 billion l of water losses daily in the United States. Pipe replacement scheduling is analyzed from an environmental perspective where, through incorporating leak impacts, a tool reveals that optimal replacement is no more than 20 years, which is in contrast to the US average of 200 years. Carbon abatement costs (CACs) are calculated for different leak reduction scenarios for the case utility that range from -$130 to -$35 t(-1) CO2(eq). Including life-cycle modeling in evaluating pipe materials identified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and cement-lined ductile iron (DICL) as the Pareto efficient options, however; utilizing PVC presents human health risks. The model developed for the case utility is applied to California and Texas to determine the CACs of reducing leaks to 5% of distributed water. For California, annual GHG savings from reducing leaks alone (3.4 million tons of CO2(eq)) are found to exceed California Air Resources Board's estimate for energy efficiency improvements in the state's water infrastructure.									19	0	0	10	0	19	1	32	1748-9326			WOS:000332072100018		J	Lowe, Melanie								Obesity and climate change mitigation in Australia: overview and analysis of policies with co-benefits								AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH				38	1			19	24		10.1111/1753-6405.12150				FEB 2014	2014	Objective: To provide an overview of the shared structural causes of obesity and climate change, and analyse policies that could be implemented in Australia to both equitably reduce obesity rates and contribute to mitigating climate change.Methods: Informed by the political economy of health theoretical framework, a review was conducted of the literature on the shared causes of, and solutions to, obesity and climate change. Policies with potential co-benefits for climate change and obesity were then analysed based upon their feasibility and capacity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and equitably reduce obesity rates in Australia.Results: Policies with potential co-benefits fit within three broad categories: those to replace car use with low-emissions, active modes of transport; those to improve diets and reduce emissions from the food system; and macro-level economic policies to reduce the over-consumption of food and fossil fuel energy.Conclusion: Given the complex causes of both problems, it is argued that a full spectrum of complementary strategies across different sectors should be utilised.Implications: Such an approach would have significant public health, social and environmental benefits.									11	0	0	2	0	11	0	25	1326-0200	1753-6405		WOS:000331258200005	24494940	J	Pasimeni, Maria Rita; Petrosillo, Irene; Aretano, Roberta; Semeraro, Teodoro; De Marco, Antonella; Zaccarelli, Nicola; Zurlini, Giovanni				Petrosillo, Irene/N-8039-2015	Petrosillo, Irene/0000-0002-7359-4095; Aretano, Roberta/0000-0001-6871-8105; Zurlini, Giovanni/0000-0002-2432-5294; Pasimeni, Maria Rita/0000-0002-9181-4354			Scales, strategies and actions for effective energy planning: A review								ENERGY POLICY				65				165	174		10.1016/j.enpol.2013.10.027				FEB 2014	2014	This paper is a review of the most recent literature on the interaction between climate change, land-use and energy, based on the analysis of papers collected through the most relevant scientific literature databases. A total of 114 papers published between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. The aims of this review are: in general (1) to identify the different research topics that have been developed related to the interaction between climate change, land-use and energy;. more specifically, (2) to analyze what are the most suitable spatial and temporal scales of investigation to focus on for actions and strategies to reduce critical issues in the field of energy and environment; (3) to identify which actions and strategies are deemed as the most appropriate to mitigate critical issues in energy and environment; and given the research gaps found in the review, (4) to propose research recommendation's in the context of effective climate-energy planning. We argue that there are certain gaps and needs for a "nested" environmental governance.

This rapid growth has proved controversial, however, and has raised concerns over potential conflicts with global food security and climate change mitigation. To address these concerns, policy support is now focused on advanced or second-generation biofuels instead of crop-based first-generation biofuels. This policy shift, together with the global financial crisis, has slowed the growth of biofuels production, which has remained stagnant since 2010. Based upon a review of the literature, this paper examines the potential long-run contribution of biofuels to the global energy mix, particularly for transportation. We find that the contribution of biofuels to global transportation fuel demand is likely to be limited to around 5% over the next 10-15 years. However, a number of studies suggest that biofuels could contribute up to a quarter of global transportation fuel demand by 2050, provided technological breakthroughs reduce the costs of sustainably produced advanced biofuels to a level where they can compete with petroleum fuels.									26	0	0	5	1	26	0	42	1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000332378500004	24298077	J	Yuksel, I.; Arman, H.

With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. This article presents a review of the energy and environmental policies in Turkey. Over the last few decades, a number of Turkish citizens who live in the eastern part of country have migrated to the western part of the country. This caused some problems in the energy utilization and environmental pollution in the western regions in Turkey. For this reason, in the coming decades, global environmental issues could significantly affect patterns of energy use in Turkey.									6	0	0	1	0	6	0	213	1556-7249			WOS:000322946000008		J	Jin, Sanghyeon; 황인창								A Prospect and Cluster Analysis Based on National Emission Features of Greenhouse Gases			기후변화협상에서 한국의 위치와 방향 - 국가별 온실가스 배출특성에 기반한 군집분석 및 전망 -					The Korea Association for Policy Studies	한국정책학회보			23	4			115	146						2014	2014	In respect to the climate change, the most serious environment problem in the human history, the conflict between advanced countries and underdeveloped countries is getting into a deadlock. After the declaration of ‘low carbon green growth’ in 2008, Korea has got the image of environment-friendly country. But the truth is that it has not showed the effective performance of greenhouse gas reduction. So this paper tries to find the current location of Korea and suggest the future direction in climate change policy. In order to achieve this goal, it adopts cluster analysis and the hypothesis of environmental Kuznets curve. First, the result of cluster analysis shows that Korea still has the emission feature of developing country, while its economic development is equal to the advanced countries' one. And the realignment among non-annex I countries was discovered. Also this paper discloses that Korea is standing at the exact turning point dividing ‘low carbon green growth’ from ‘high carbon grey growth’ by using the hypothesis of environmental Kuznets curve. In conclusion, it suggests that Korea needs fundamental reformation in order to be a low carbon country.				인류 최대의 환경문제인 기후변화와 관련해서 선진국과 개도국･후진국 간의 대립이 심각하게 진행되고 있다. 한국은 2008년에 ‘저탄소 녹색성장’을 국가발전전략으로 제시하면서, 국제사회에서 친환경적인 국가라는 이미지를 획득할 수 있었다. 그렇지만 정작 제대로 된 온실가스 감축 성과는 보여주지 못하고 있는 실정이다. 이에 본 논문에서는 한국의 온실가스 배출특성에 대한 고려를 통해 과거와 현재의 위치뿐만 아니라 미래의 발전 방향을 제시하고자 한다. 이를 위해 본 논문은 과거의 실적 자료를 이용하는 군집분석과 전망 제시를 위한 이론적 자원으로 환경쿠즈네츠 가설을 활용하고 있다. 먼저 군집분석 결과를 살펴보면, 온실가스 배출특성을 고려했을 때 한국은 선진국이 아닌 개도국의 성향을 여전히 지니고 있는 것으로 나타났다. 한 가지 특징적으로는 비의무 감축국 사이의 분화과정이 최근 들어 빠르게 진행된다는 사실이 확인되었다. 또한 환경쿠즈네츠 곡선을 이용해 국가 발전경로를 검토한 결과, 한국은 기존의 ‘고탄소 회색성장’과 ‘저탄소 녹색성장’의 경로가 구분되는 경계지점에 위치한 것으로 밝혀졌다. 이에 본 논문에서는 박근혜 정부가 저탄소 국가로 거듭나기 위해서는 시스템 전반의 근본적･구조적인 개혁이 요구된다는 정책적 함의를 결론으로 제시하고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1226-5497			KJD:ART001951067		S	Morris, William J.; Sjostrom, Sharon; Sayyah, Maryam; Denney, Jayson; Syed, Omar; Lindsey, Charles; Lindsay, Meghan						Dixon, T; Herzog, H; Twinning, S		ADA's solid sorbent CO2 capture process: developing solid sorbent technology to provide the necessary flexible CO2 capture solutions for a wide range of applications								12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES, GHGT-12		Energy Procedia		63				1536	1545		10.1016/j.egypro.2014.11.163				2014	2014	Thermal power plant efficiency upgrades and fuel switching from coal to natural gas will not be sufficient for meeting societal needs for decarbonization of the world's electric generating fleet. While coal remains an abundant and more cost effective fuel worldwide than natural gas, recent gas production in North America has driven a significant movement towards fuel switching from coal to gas. However, fuel switching alone will not be a practical method for necessary CO2 emissions reductions. As a result, CO2 capture technologies need to be developed which are scalable from process heaters and small gas plants to 1,000 MWe coal generating units. Retrofit technologies will also be needed because it will take decades to overhaul the entire electric generating infrastructure. Post-combustion CO2 capture will be needed to facilitate progressive CO2 emissions reductions from existing infrastructure as well as being able to flexibly adapt to any new fossil flue gas stream to provide the necessary CO2 emissions reductions for future regulatory compliance.Carbon mitigation regulations are being discussed in several countries. The United States' Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) proposed a new rule, "Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units" in April 2013 for new construction of power plants in the United States, which indicated an emissions limit of 1,100 lbs/MWhr for coal fired power plants. Natural gas combined cycle plants do not require CO2 capture technology for the current EPA proposal.For coal fired power plants, this emissions rate does not require 90% or more CO2 capture, and instead only calls for similar to 40-50% CO2 capture from a unit depending upon the specific steam cycle and fuel utilized. As a result, high capital cost technologies such as oxy-fuel combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with precombustion CO2 capture for coal fueled applications may not be economically advantageous under this proposed regulation. However, an advantage of post-combustion capture, unlike integrated gasification combined cycle or oxy-fuel retrofit, is that it may be implemented as a trim over a broad range of CO2 capture from similar to 5-90% to meet potential regulatory requirements and industry needs with a potentially significantly lower capital expense necessary for compliance. In addition, post-combustion CO2 capture technology may be adapted to gas fired applications in the future indicating its value as a developmental technology in a time of regulatory uncertainty.In order to explore the costs and technical challenges associated with providing large scale CO2 capture at coal fired power plants over a wide range of potential capture requirements, ADA has developed a 500 MWe conceptual design for a post-combustion CO2 capture unit that utilizes solid sorbents. ADA has also recently completed construction of a first-in-the-world, 1 MWe scale, CO2 capture pilot facility that utilizes dry solid sorbents and fluidized bed technology to efficiently capture CO2 from power plant flue gas without the energy penalties associated with heating and evaporating water-based liquid amine solvents. This facility will commence operation in 2014 and be used to validate models and assumptions used to scale solid-sorbent CO2 capture technology to necessary levels for industrial compliance. In addition, the design and construction exercise of the 1 MWe pilot plant has aided in performing cost estimates that may be compared to liquid amine-based post-combustion capture systems using methodology based upon the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory's Carbon Capture reports of Cases 10 and 12. ADA has also compared the energy penalties and potential impacts to the levelized costs of electricity associated with a range of partial capture scenarios to assess the relative costs of partial capture compared with 90% CO2 capture.This study shows how solid-sorbent post-combustion capture technology can provide advantages over aqueous amine technology as well as providing flexible solutions to CO2 capture needs at a wide range of scales and in an environment of regulatory uncertainty.

It is very true that fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, which is the cause of the greenhouse effect. This Greenhouse effect is the major reason for climate change. Therefore, this climate change problem is related to an energy challenge. The effective measure that reduces carbon emission is the replacement of conventional combustion fossil fuel into renewable energies like solar, wind, water, tides and geothermal heat. In order to recover the climate change, we require greenhouse gas reduction using renewable sources with effective ICTs. ICT embedded renewable energy storage system can enable wider geographic scopes of grid integration, optimized energy demand management and dynamic pricing. The paper discussed about the Information and Communication Technologies through renewable energy sources (RES) to employ green energy and environment.

Petroleum fuels remain the dominant energy source, reflecting advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and market availability. The movement of people and freight makes a major contribution to economic development and social well-being, but it also negatively impacts climate change, air quality, health, social cohesion, and safety. Following a review published 20 years ago in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources (then named the Annual Review of Energy and the Environment) by Lee Schipper, we examine current trends and potential futures, revising several major global transport/energy reports. There are significant opportunities to slow travel growth and improve efficiency. Alternatives to petroleum exist but have different characteristics in terms of availability, cost, distribution, infrastructure, storage, and public acceptability. The transition to low-carbon equitable and sustainable transport will take time but can be fostered by numerous short-and medium-term strategies that would benefit energy security, health, productivity, and sustainability.									18	0	0	0	0	18	1	39	1543-5938		978-0-8243-2339-4	WOS:000348446900012		J	Maekawa, Miko								Effective Environmental Regimes in East Asia for Climate Change and Environmental Security								THE JOURNAL OF PEACE STUDIES	평화학연구			15	6			7	30		10.14363/kaps.2014.15.6.7				2014	2014	The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the United Nations (UN) and regional collaboration in tackling climate change and environmental security in East Asia. East Asia plays critical roles in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In order to seek environmental sustainability, the aspect of so-called planetary boundaries also should be taken into consideration, by assessing the thresholds of climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle, and others. However, compared to the active economic regional integration, transboundary cooperation in environmental management is rather weak. Despite the regional environmental agreements, the actual implementation and the impacts are quite limited. In East Asia, regional environmental initiatives did not evolve into formal institutions. Cases of the Montreal Protocol and Mekong River transboundary management are examined to draw concrete lessons for effective regional frameworks. Elements for success are to embrace scientific rigor and flexible legal framework for implementation, trade provisions, give support to developing countries through multilateral processes, including the UN and the broader framework for cooperation, including not only the environment, but also socio and economic bargaining. The participation of the super powers in the agreement is also crucial. The environmental concerns should be reflected in the existing regional trade and economic frameworks in the region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1738-2580			KJD:ART001947945		S	Yusoff, Haslinda; Darus, Faizah						Sanusi, ZM; Said, J		Mitigation of climate change and prevention of pollution activities: environmental disclosure practice in Islamic financial institutions								INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT (ICGSM) 2014		Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		145				195	203		10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.06.027				2014	2014	This study aims to explore the environmental disclosure practice from an Islamic perspective.

We therefore consider the energy sector of a small country that optimizes a portfolio consisting of fossil and/or renewable energy to cover a given energy demand, considering seasonal fluctuations in renewable energy generation. By solving these non-autonomous optimal control models with infinite horizon, we investigate the impact of fossil energy prices on the annual optimal portfolio composition shown by the obtained periodic solutions.					9th International Conference on Large-Scale Scientific Computations (LSSC)9th International Conference on Large-Scale Scientific Computations (LSSC)	JUN 03-07, 2013JUN 03-07, 2013	Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Informat & Commun TechnologiesBulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Informat & Commun Technologies	Sozopol, BULGARIASozopol, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-662-43880-0; 978-3-662-43879-4	WOS:000345642700014		J	de Jongh, Derick; Moellmann, Carmen M.					de Jongh, Derick/0000-0002-7265-368X			MARKET BARRIERS FOR VOLUNTARY CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRIVATE SECTOR								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES				17	5			639	652		10.4102/sajems.v17i5.532				2014	2014	A key challenge in the twenty-first century is to enable economic growth and increase both environmental quality and social inclusiveness, while mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. The need for a transition to more sustainable consumption and production patterns is undeniable and sustainable economic growth must be placed at the heart of future development for all citizens. The South African private sector is under enormous pressure to remain globally competitive while balancing the interests of society, the environment and its shareholders. It has been suggested that there are discrepancies between what companies say and what they actually do, as they are challenged to move from policy to action. This paper evaluates the extent to which the private sector in South Africa adheres to voluntary climate change mitigation mechanisms and identifies potential market barriers impeding the large-scale uptake of such mechanisms. The research findings suggest that the private sector in South Africa has adopted a "take position, wait and see approach" which places them in a position to take advantage of and influence the opportunities and risks associated with climate change without having a negative impact on the bottom line. The primary barrier to voluntary climate change action is the vagueness of local and international policy frameworks. The different rules and resultant uncertainty around local and international frameworks appear to impede consistent and meaningful action. Although this uncertainty does not prevent the private sector from taking voluntary action, it does appear to negatively affect the overall scale and type of climate change mitigation efforts. While companies are continually improving the quality of sustainability reporting and public disclosure, the challenge still lies in translating these strategies into daily operations and sustainable practice that goes beyond ad hoc mitigation actions.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	11	2222-3436			WOS:000345839000009		S	Kokkaew, Nakhon; Sampim, Tatcha					Kokkaew, Nakhon/0000-0001-5253-036X	OThong, S; Waewsak, J		Improving Economic Assessments of Clean Development Mechanism Projects Using Real Options								2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND EMERGING ECONOMIES (2013 AEDCEE)		Energy Procedia		52				449	458		10.1016/j.egypro.2014.07.097				2014	2014	Currently, there is increasing pressure from global community to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, the main cause of climate change. One of several programs to reduce the greenhouse gas is Clean Development Mechanism or CDM by the United Nation. The amount of greenhouse gas reduction through CDM projects in developing countries can be sold to developed countries so that they can increase the maximum cap of the emissions to be emitted into the environment. It is this carbon credit from CDM projects that is of financial value, and thus should be viewed as a new type of asset. This could help improve the financial outlook of CDM projects such as renewable energy generators (REGs) because not only these projects usually involve higher costs of technology but also high uncertainty from the prices fluctuation of input commodity, output products, and carbon credits, for instance. Valuing CDM projects full of uncertainty by conventional discounted cash flow (DCF) approaches such as net present value (NPV) could underestimate the intrinsic value and inherent risk of these projects. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to propose a new approach for valuing the financial viability of CDM projects that considers risk, flexibility, and carbon credit into the economic analysis, using real options theory and risk-flexibility theory.

In rapidly developing urban-regions, the ability of the local planning authorities to quantify the spatial structure and form of existing urban areas, new developments and the emergent urban-region in terms of GHG emission is vital to any effective local, national and global climate change mitigation effort. While a wide array of tools has been developed for assessing built environment sustainability at various spatial scales, these are predominantly eco-efficiency rating tools that do not model the 'spatial structure-GHG' relationship and do not illustrate the GHG implications of urban structure and form, which crucially inform local planning decisions with respect to climate change mitigation. This paper takes the first steps in analysing three spatial-based planning models (Envision Tomorrow, GHGProof, URBEMIS) that estimate GHG emissions towards assessing their adaptability for application in Malaysian cities. It looks into the models' "inner working", unpacking the variables and their relationships; assumptions and conversion rates used; and their data requirement and structure. The models' characteristics and features are critically compared to evaluate their capabilities, limitations and relevance to the Malaysian urban planning context, particularly in terms of data availability.					8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)8th International Symposium of the Digital Earth (ISDE)	AUG 26-29, 2013AUG 26-29, 2013	Univ Malaysia Sarawak; Sarawak Convent Bur; Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur; ESRI; FRIM; JKPTG; JUPEM; NRE; ANGKASAUniv Malaysia Sarawak; Sarawak Convent Bur; Malaysia Convent & Exhibit Bur; ESRI; FRIM; JKPTG; JUPEM; NRE; ANGKASA	Univ Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIAUniv Teknologi Malaysia, Inst Geospatial Sci & Technol, Kuching, MALAYSIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	1755-1307		*****************	WOS:000345268900158		J	SungMoonBae; KwanheeHan; SangHyunChoi; 박주현								Development of Seat Recommendation System for the Collaboration in Smart Work Center			스마트워크센터 환경에서 협업을 위한 좌석 추천 시스템 개발					Journal of the Korean Institute of Industrial Engineers	대한산업공학회지			40	1			128	134		10.7232/JKIIE.2014.40.1.128				2014	2014	With the development of Information Communication Technology and a way of solving problems such as productivity improvement, advanced working attitude, greenhouse gas reduction, low birth rate, aged problem, etc., the need of smart work is increasing. Getting out of legacy working types that are limited in time and space, the flexible seat system at a smart work center that supports the smart working environment is proposed. However, the seat choice based on employee’s emotional judgement may cause the decline of forming cooperative space and mutual communication because of the scattered seat arrangement between employees.

A Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) was commissioned to develop guiding principles for GPO investments. Here we offer commentary on the BRP report from scholars in multiple disciplines that study the oceans: environmental economics, environmental politics, fisheries science, physical oceanography, and political economy. The BRP is a prominent, unique group of individuals representing diverse interests of GPO partners. We applaud the call for knowledge creation, but identify diverse issues that the BRP omitted: the need for effective governance to address data-poor stocks so that gaps do not dictate solutions; the deployment of projects that facilitate learning about governance effectiveness through program evaluation; and the importance of large-scale coordination of data collection in furthering the BRP's call for capacity building. Commenters' opinions are mixed on the likely impact of the report's recommendations on ocean health, governance, and economic development, but they highlight several key features of the report. A centerpiece of the report that distinguishes it from most previous high-level reports on the oceans is the prominence given to human well-being. The report emphasizes the commons problem as a critical institutional failure that must be addressed and focuses heavily on market-based mechanisms to improve governance. The report successfully acknowledges tradeoffs-across different stakeholders as well as across human well-being and ocean health but there is little specific guidance on how to make these tradeoffs. Historical tensions among GPO partners run deep, and resolving them will require more than high-level principles. For instance, it is unclear how to resolve the potential conflict between proprietary data and the report's stated desire for transparency and open access to information. Some differences may ultimately be irreconcilable. The report appropriately advocates flexibility for the GPO to adapt solutions to particulars of a problem, avoiding the trap of one size fits all. However, flexibility is also a weakness because the BRP does not provide guidance on how best to approach problems that span multiple scales. Some scales may be beyond the scope of the GPO; for example, the GPO cannot meaningfully contribute to global climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, the GPO could play an important role in climate adaptation by facilitating the development of governance regimes that are resilient to climate-induced species migrations.									6	0	0	1	0	6	0	32	0738-1360	2334-5985		WOS:000336194700001		J	Gunawansa, Asanga; Kua, Harn Wei								A Comparison of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for the Construction Industries of Three Coastal Territories								SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT				22	1			52	62		10.1002/sd.527				JAN 2014	2014	The success of climate change strategies depends on how well mitigation and adaptation measures are implemented. It is especially important to implement effective mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal territories because they will be more directly affected by some of the possible effects of climate change. This study assessed and compared how Singapore, Miami-Dade and San Francisco - three coastal territories - implement climate change strategies in their construction industries. Case study method - in which primary and secondary information was collected and analyzed - was used. It was found that these three territories have a few similarities; for example, Singapore and San Francisco mandate green building requirements, whereas Singapore and Miami-Dade do not explicitly consider adaptation measures in their building codes. It was also noted that although mitigation has entered mainstream policy-making, adaptation still lags behind. Consequently, this study has proposed a few lessons; for example, policy-makers in Singapore and Miami-Dade should complement existing measures with platforms to engage the public on disaster management.

Various policies jointly influence the development of transport systems, some policies implying different or even contradictory designs for future transport systems. Policy interplay has not been much addressed in previous research on sustainability transitions. This article combines the technological innovation system (TIS) functions, within the transitions framework, with policy analysis to empirically map multiple policies and their intended paths towards low-carbon transport systems. Empirically, the article provides a systematic review of Finnish national-level policies for transport and transport-related innovation. The discussion examines the contribution of the current policy mix to sustainability transitions based on its degree of attempt to re-design the transport system. The findings reveal that policy support is more comprehensive regarding more energy-efficient vehicles and low-carbon fuels than based on reduced transport demand or alternative transport modes. A holistic policy approach towards low-carbon transitions is only achieved to a degree and innovation policy gaps are identified.

Thus the discussions on the technology strategies for Green IT analysis and Green IT classification are not satisfactory. To establish an analytical framework of Green IT application and corporate Green IT strategies, this study has established the concept of Green IT through the investigation of current trends in Green IT and previous studies on Green IT classification systems and then systemized the top factors and sub factors of the analysis system. To test the validity of questionnaires, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, and then to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship for the top factors constructed by an exploratory factor analysis, a confirmatory factor analysis which is a structured equation model was conducted. By utilizing Green IT application cases for individual industries based on research models derived in these manners, the implications for the green IT strategy for individual industries were suggested. Furthermore, to evaluate the Green IT standards of businesses, standards evaluation indexes were suggested based upon an analytic framework, a research model, which is the objective and scope of this study.					5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)5th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)	OCT 22-24, 2014OCT 22-24, 2014	Korean Inst Commun & Informat Sci; Elect & Telecommunicat Res Inst; Korea Commun Agcy; Korean Federat Sci & Technol Soc; SAMSUNG ELECT; kt; SK telecom; LG Elect; QUALCOMM; ERICSSON LG; BUSAN TOURISM ORG; GSI; innoPia Technologies; DASAN Network; Multi Screen Serv Forum Korea; IEEE Commun Soc; IEICE Commun SocKorean Inst Commun & Informat Sci; Elect & Telecommunicat Res Inst; Korea Commun Agcy; Korean Federat Sci & Technol Soc; SAMSUNG ELECT; kt; SK telecom; LG Elect; QUALCOMM; ERICSSON LG; BUSAN TOURISM ORG; GSI; innoPia Technologies; DASAN Network; Multi Screen Serv Forum Korea; IEEE Commun Soc; IEICE Commun Soc	Minist Sci ICT & Future Planning, Busan, SOUTH KOREAMinist Sci ICT & Future Planning, Busan, SOUTH KOREA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	2162-1233		978-1-4799-6786-5	WOS:000393480800147		S	Zoran, Maria A.; Savastru, Roxana S.; Savastru, Dan M.; Tautan, Marina N.; Baschir, Laurentiu A.

Urban land covers as the biophysical state of the earth's surface and immediate subsurface are sources and sinks for most of the material and energy movements and interactions between the geosphere and biosphere. Climate change is considered to be the biggest environmental threat in the future in the South-Eastern part of Europe. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influences of urban growth on urban thermal environment as well as the relationships of thermal characteristics to other biophysical parameters in Bucharest metropolitan area of Romania based on time series MODIS Terra/Aqua and IKONOS data acquired during 2000-2014 periods. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable for studying urban land surface processes and surface atmosphere interactions, being a crucial component in the study of the surface energy and water budgets. Urbanization created an evolved inverse relationship between impervious and vegetation coverage, and brought about new LST patterns because of LST's correlations with both impervious and vegetation coverage. City thermal environment risk management strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change must propose efficient plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cool the city through changes in the built environment, land use, and transportation.

These devices are critical enabling technologies for renewable energy; energy management, conservation, and storage; pollution control/monitoring; and greenhouse gas reduction. A large number of electrochemical energy technologies have been developed in the past. These systems continue to be optimized in terms of cost, life time, and performance, leading to their continued expansion into existing and emerging market sectors. The more established technologies such as deep-cycle batteries and sensors are being joined by emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium-ion batteries, electrochemical reactors; ion transport membranes and supercapacitors. This growing demand (multi billion dollars) for electrochemical energy systems along with the increasing maturity of a number of technologies is having a significant effect on the global research and development effort which is increasing in both in size and depth. A number of new technologies, which will have substantial impact on the environment and the way we produce and utilize energy, are under development. This paper presents an overview of several emerging electrochemical energy technologies along with a discussion some of the key technical challenges.									64	1	0	6	0	64	4	74	2296-2646			WOS:000209678600082	25309898	S	Tokarcik, Alexander; Rovnak, Martin			SGEM					REDUCING CARBON FOOTPRINT IN EASTERN SLOVAKIA								GEOCONFERENCE ON ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, VOL 1 (SGEM 2014)		International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference-SGEM						449	456						2014	2014	Regional policy and measures adopted by each government in its decisions are one of the tools in reducing carbon footprint. Operation of public buildings contributes to the total energy consumption in the EU and CO2 emissions. Currently there are effective solutions leading to a reduction of energy intensity in the operation of public buildings. Reducing energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources in buildings represents important measures needed to reduce energy dependence and greenhouse gas reductions. Analysis of the current state and the design of appropriate solutions and actions can help regions to focus their resources on a few key priorities instead of distributing their investments between the different areas and the business sector.					14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM)14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM)	JUN 17-26, 2014JUN 17-26, 2014	Bulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Repub; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Letters; Acad Sci Maldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environ & WaterBulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Repub; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Letters; Acad Sci Maldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environ & Water	Albena, BULGARIAAlbena, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1314-2704		978-619-7105-15-5	WOS:000371089600058		S	Blumberga, Dagnija; Kalnins, Silvija Nora; Gusca, Julija; Valtere, Sarma						Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		ANALYSIS OF ROLE OF NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS IN EDUCATING ON CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES								INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE		INTED Proceedings						134	143						2014	2014	Climate change mitigation can be achieved through different instruments: policy requirements, technological approaches to minimise greenhouse gases, forestry and agriculture management, educational and public information activities and others.

Lately, research related to soil organic carbon has been a main focus worldwide, motivated by the potential the soil inhabits to become a manageable sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus to mitigate climate change and the known benefits of increased soil organic carbon for the functioning of soils. Here, challenges are highlighted for soil organic carbon research that we are currently facing. Knowledge on soil organic carbon dynamics in the soil system is briefly reviewed, followed by an elaboration on how soil organic carbon dynamics and soil organic carbon stocks have been modelled in space and time and where modelling needs to go.

The project aimed to provide impact assessment frameworks and influence relevant policies through direct involvement in bioenergy projects and policy analysis in South Africa, Uganda, India and China. The papers summarised here have covered issues related to Jatropha curcas and forest-based bioenergy in these countries. Taking an overall look at the project findings we can identify a number of general conclusions relevant for the future of bioenergy and rural development in Africa and Asia. First, only local and context-specific sustainability assessment can identify the risk and responsibilities of the different groups and the exact impact on the environment. Second, many initiatives both in biofuels and forest-based bioenergy are marred by a lack of understanding of the life-cycle financial analysis. Third, careful consideration of local physical and social conditions and the economics of the production chain can identify real opportunities for rural development using bioenergy. The current global impasse in bioenergy policies could actually be advantageous to the development of bioenergy in developing countries. Without the pressure from America and Europe to develop bioenergy systems for climate change mitigation, countries in Africa and Asia may have the breathing room to shape bioenergy systems for their own internal energy supply in an orderly fashion. However, in order to avoid environmental and social impacts it will be necessary to articulate together elements of a number of measures including market-based certification, national policy formulation, national legislation, impact assessments, sustainability planning, land use planning, research, monitoring and evaluation taking into account country and project specific sustainability criteria. Unfortunately, many of the countries in Africa and Asia where bioenergy can play an important role still lack institutional structures able to articulate this sustainable development.

This study uses a long term spatial archive of rainfall observations for the Eyre Peninsula (South Australia) to estimate the spatial and temporal impacts of climate change on wheat yield. The three step process involved: (1) cluster analysis and statistical comparison to spatially distinguish heterogeneous "hazardscapes" (places that represent the physical susceptibility to hazards (Khan, 2012)); (2) using historical rainfall reliabilities to estimate the probability of receiving rainfall within a range of predefined thresholds and season for each hazardscape; (3) applying 2030 and 2070 climate change projections to determine the potential future impacts on rainfall. Nine hazardscapes were spatially differentiated each having temporally different historical seasonal rainfall reliabilities. Variations over space and time mean that the impacts of climate change will be spatially explicit. Projected rainfall reductions for 2030 showed marginal impact on hazardscapes with low seasonal reliabilities, primarily in winter and spring. The 2070 projections showed that some hazardscapes were unlikely to receive past rates of rainfall thus limiting the ongoing prospects of current and perhaps the potential adoption of alternative rain-fed land uses. Reductions in rainfall for hazardscapes with higher historical rainfall reliabilities will cause negative impacts on crop development. The ability to quantify the potential spatial and temporal impacts of climate change on seasonal trends will inform land managers' climate change mitigation and adaptation pathways.

The basic assumption of these schemes was that these acquisitions would benefit both the economy and the environment as older and less fuel-efficient cars were scrapped and replaced with more fuel-efficient models. In this article, we present a new environmental impact assessment method for assessing the effectiveness of scrappage schemes for reducing CO2 emissions taking into account the rebound effect, driving behavior for older versus new cars and entire lifecycle emissions for during the manufacturing processes of new cars. The assessment of the Japanese scrappage scheme shows that CO2 emissions would only decrease if users of the scheme retained their new gasoline passenger vehicles for at least 4.7 years. When vehicle replacements were restricted to hybrid cars, the reduction in CO2 achieved by the scheme would be 6-8.5 times higher than the emissions resulting from a scheme involving standard, gasoline passenger vehicles. Cost-benefit analysis, based on the emission reduction potential, showed that the scheme was very costly. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Japanese government failed to determine the optimum, or target, car age for scrapping old cars in the scheme. Specifically, scrapping cars aged 13 years and over did not maximize the environmental benefits of the scheme. Consequently, modifying this policy to include a reduction in new car subsidies, focused funding for fuel-efficient cars, and modifying the target car age, would increase environmental benefits.

However, the significance of its freshwater biodiversity is not well understood. This review provides an updated account of species richness in rivers in the Mediterranean region (med-region) of southwestern Australia. Taxonomic knowledge of many aquatic invertebrate groups in this region has improved significantly in the last two decades as a result of ecological surveys and government funding for taxonomic research. Of the 662 species of plants and animals surveyed, 43% were found to be endemic to the region, yet when taxonomic groups were considered separately, levels of endemism were varied. To date, few aquatic species from the med-region are listed as threatened; however, many more species would be expected to be included if assessed against appropriate criteria. Conservation efforts are focussed on climate change mitigation and managing the impacts of broad scale land clearing for agriculture. Reserve design and location of important nature reserves on the extreme south coast, limits the ability for species' movement to cooler, wetter regions. This will necessitate supporting restoration which leads to increased resilience in freshwater ecosystems to withstand the combined effects of climate change and land use.									10	0	0	9	0	10	1	53	0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000325182400010		J	Tatrallyay, Nicholas; Stadelmann, Martin								Climate change mitigation and international finance: the effectiveness of the Clean Development Mechanism and the Global Environment Facility in India and Brazil								MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE				18	7			903	919		10.1007/s11027-012-9398-y				OCT 2013	2013	This study analyzes the effectiveness and efficiency of the two principal United Nations (UN) climate change mitigation finance mechanisms, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The realised abatement and costs of the two mechanisms in India and Brazil (using data from 28 GEF and 233 CDM project documents) are compared with theoretical marginal abatement cost curves, based on bottom-up technology studies. We find that both mechanisms have focused on negative and low-cost abatement potential but still leave substantial theoretical potential in this cost range untapped. CDM has more effectively harvested abatement potential of industrial gases and methane emissions, whereas GEF has more successfully targeted demand-side energy efficiency (EE) and transport emission reduction opportunities. CDM has excelled at capturing abatement potential in areas with a limited understanding of abatement, highlighting the shortcomings of theoretical estimates (such as Marginal Abatement Cost Curves) and the benefits of a market mechanism. In some sectors and technologies (particularly renewable energy), the two mechanisms overlapped, which suggests a need for better coordination in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	26	1381-2386	1573-1596		WOS:000324113400002		J	Berggren, Bjorn; Wall, Maria								Calculation of thermal bridges in (Nordic) building envelopes - Risk of performance failure due to inconsistent use of methodology								ENERGY AND BUILDINGS				65				331	339		10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.06.021				OCT 2013	2013	Reduction of energy use in buildings is an important measure to achieve climate change mitigation. It is essential to minimize heat losses when designing and building energy efficient buildings. For an energy-efficient building in a cold climate, a large part of the space heating demand is caused by transmission losses through the building envelope. Therefore, calculations of these must be carried out in a correct way to ensure a properly sized heating system and a good indoor climate. There is today a risk of misunderstanding and inconsistent use of methodology when transmission heat transfer is calculated. To investigate the state of knowledge among Swedish consultants a survey was conducted regarding thermal bridges and calculations of transmission heat transfer. Furthermore, the impact of thermal bridges was studied by comparative calculations for a case study building with different building systems and different amounts of insulation. The study shows that the relevant standards and the building code in Sweden are interpreted in many different ways regarding calculation of transmission heat transfer and energy performance. There is a lack of understanding regarding the impact of different measuring methods on thermal bridges. When more insulation is used the relative impact of thermal bridges increases. It is therefore not suitable to use a single predefined percentage factor, increasing the transmission heat transfer through building elements, to account for the effect of thermal bridges. If values for normalized thermal bridges are to be used, they need to be differentiated by building system and different amounts of insulation (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Yet this trend will not continue forever. Despite technological innovation, finite fossil fuel reserves will in the long run lead to increasing costs of transport. Moreover, to fight global warming many governments have set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, and to achieve them fossil fuels must become more expensive either through market developments or by political intervention. This paper gives an overview about the drivers, feedbacks and constraints of urban mobility and location in a possible future in which transport energy will no longer be abundant and cheap. It asks whether current urban models are able to adequately model the impacts of significantly higher transport costs and demonstrates by an example how it can be done. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little information is available on the on-site causes of DFD in these areas. This paper estimates the levels of DFD and identifies the drivers in the Ankasa Conservation Area (ACA) in Ghana as a case study. A survey was used to identify both direct and underlying factors that promote the DFD. The extent of deforestation was estimated using satellite images. The survey data were analyzed using rankings and ordinal logistic regression techniques, while digital image classification and change detection were used to analyze land cover changes. The results show that DFD occurred at a higher rate in the periphery of the ACA compared to the core-protected and the farthest areas. Agricultural and wood harvesting activities were the main direct causes of DFD. Poverty and large in-migrations of people for cocoa farming were important underlying economic and population growth factors. To address these problems and enable ACA to contribute more to biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, the community resource management institutions should be fully adopted and strengthened and priority given to livelihood improvement and ecosystem services provision in the periphery of the ACA.

There are well-established process-based models that can be used to simulate SOC stock evolution; however, there are few plant residue C input values and those that exist represent a limited range of environments. This limitation in a fundamental model component (i.e., C input) constrains the reliability of current SOC stock simulations. This study aimed to estimate crop-specific and environment-specific plant-derived soil C input values for agricultural sites in France based on data from 700 sites selected from a recently established French soil monitoring network (the RMQS database). Measured SOC stock values from this large scale soil database were used to constrain an inverse RothC modelling approach to derive estimated C input values consistent with the stocks. This approach allowed us to estimate significant crop-specific C input values (P < 0.05) for 14 out of 17 crop types in the range from 1.84 +/- 0.69 t C ha(-1) year(-1) (silage corn) to 5.15 +/- 0.12 t C ha(-1) year(-1) (grassland/pasture). Furthermore, the incorporation of climate variables improved the predictions. C input of 4 crop types could be predicted as a function of temperature and 8 as a function of precipitation. This study offered an approach to meet the urgent need for crop-specific and environment-specific C input values in order to improve the reliability of SOC stock prediction.									13	2	0	13	0	13	3	88	1002-0160			WOS:000322562000003		J	Dholakia, Hem H.; Purohit, Pallav; Rao, Shilpa; Garg, Amit				Purohit, Pallav/I-3938-2019	Purohit, Pallav/0000-0002-7265-6960; Rao, Shilpa/0000-0003-4012-9063			Impact of current policies on future air quality and health outcomes in Delhi, India								ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT				75				241	248		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.04.052				AUG 2013	2013	A key policy challenge in Indian megacities is to curb high concentrations of PM2.5 and mitigate associated adverse health impacts. Using the Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model we carry out an integrated analysis of the air quality regulations across different sectors for the city of Delhi. Our findings show that PM2.5 concentrations for Delhi will not reach the recommended national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) even by 2030 under the current policies scenario. Adopting advanced control technologies reduces PM2.5 concentrations by about 60% and all-cause mortality by half in 2030. Climate change mitigation policies significantly reduce greenhouse gases, but have a modest impact on reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Stringent policies to control the net flow of air pollution from trans-boundary sources will play a crucial role in reducing pollution levels in Delhi city. Achieving NAAQS requires a stringent policy portfolio that combines advanced control technologies with a switch to cleaner fuels and the control of trans-boundary pollution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To address those needs, the GRACEnet (Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network) and REAP (Renewable Energy Assessment Project) research programs were initiated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS). A major product of these programs is the creation of a database with greenhouse gas fluxes, soil carbon stocks, biomass yield, nutrient, and energy characteristics, and input data for modeling cropped and grazed systems. The data include site descriptors (e.g., weather, soil class, spatial attributes), experimental design (e.g., factors manipulated, measurements performed, plot layouts), management information (e.g., planting and harvesting schedules, fertilizer types and amounts, biomass harvested, grazing intensity), and measurements (e.g., soil C and N stocks, plant biomass amount and chemical composition). To promote standardization of data and ensure that experiments were fully described, sampling protocols and a spreadsheet-based data-entry template were developed. Data were first uploaded to a temporary database for checking and then were uploaded to the central database. A Web-accessible application allows for registered users to query and download data including measurement protocols. Separate portals have been provided for each project (GRACEnet and REAP) at nrrc.ars.usda.gov/slgracenet/#/Home and nrrc.ars.usda.gov/slreap/#/Home. The database architecture and data entry template have proven flexible and robust for describing a wide range of field experiments and thus appear suitable for other natural resource research projects.									23	0	0	16	0	23	0	26	0047-2425			WOS:000321822300034	24216379	J	Natuhara, Yosihiro				Natuhara, Yosihiro/I-6387-2014	Natuhara, Yosihiro/0000-0003-0481-6659			Ecosystem services by paddy fields as substitutes of natural wetlands in Japan								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				56		SI		97	106		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2012.04.026				JUL 2013	2013	This paper reviews research on the ecosystem services or multifunctionality of paddy rice cultivation in Japan, focusing on biodiversity as a basis for ecosystem services, with the aim of describing the current status and impact of the subject and exploring options for sustainable practices. Ecosystem services provided by paddy fields include; groundwater recharge, production of non-rice foods, flood control, soil erosion and landslide prevention, climate-change mitigation, water purification, culture and landscape, and support of ecosystems and biodiversity. Among these services, the value of services that regulate ecosystem functions was estimated to be US$ 72.8 billion in Japan. More than 5000 species have been recorded in paddy fields and the surrounding environment. Because paddy fields are artificially disturbed by water level management, plowing, and harvest, most species move between paddy fields and the surrounding environment. The linkage between paddy fields and the associated environment plays an important role in biodiversity. Two changes that have affected the ecosystem of paddy fields are modernization and abandonment of farming. Satoyama, a traditional socio-ecological production landscape, which provided a functional linkage between paddy fields and the associated environment has lost its functions. Biodiversity-conscious rice farming has been promoted by collaborations among farmers, consumers and governments. Biodiversity certification programs are successful examples Of biodiversity-conscious framing. In these programs incentives include direct payments and/or premium prices paid by consumers, as well as farmers willingness to improve the safety of food and environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The relevant sustainable development and building policies as well as the building design, construction and maintenance strategies should jointly respond both to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.What should city developers focus on in order to plan a sustainable and safe city in a changing climate? This paper provides answers to this question, presenting a bottom-up methodology based on a generalized building typology of the residential building stock in order to estimate the mitigation potential and vulnerability of the residential sector.During the research, a case study has been implemented in Hungary to assess the structural impacts and vulnerability on the roof, particularly with respect to the wind load and to estimate the potential decrease of CO2 emission through refurbishment. Through the case study the paper highlights the most problematic areas of the city both from vulnerability and mitigation point of view where the attention of the city developers should be turned.

Community Participation and Benefits in REDD plus : A Review of Initial Outcomes and Lessons								FORESTS				4	2			296	318		10.3390/f4020296				JUN 2013	2013	The advent of initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks (REDD+) in developing countries has raised much concern regarding impacts on local communities. To inform this debate, we analyze the initial outcomes of those REDD+ projects that systematically report on their socio-economic dimensions. To categorize and compare projects, we develop a participation and benefits framework that considers REDD+'s effects on local populations' opportunities (jobs, income), security (of tenure and ecosystem services), and empowerment (participation in land use and development decisions). We find material benefits, in terms of jobs and income, to be, thus far, modest. On the other hand, we find that many projects are helping populations gain tenure rights. A majority of projects are obtaining local populations' free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). However, for those projects interacting with multiple populations, extent of participation and effects on forest access are often uneven. Our participation and benefits framework can be a useful tool for identifying the multi-faceted socio-economic impacts of REDD+, which are realized under different timescales. The framework and initial trends reported here can be used to build hypotheses for future REDD+ impact evaluations and contribute to evolving theories of incentive-based environmental policy.									50	1	0	13	0	50	0	73	1999-4907			WOS:000320773200006		J	Ervine, Kate								Carbon Markets, Debt and Uneven Development								THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY				34	4			653	670		10.1080/01436597.2013.786288				MAY 1 2013	2013	The United Nations Clean Development Mechanism (cdm) has been envisaged as a powerful tool for reconciling the global South's environment and development problematic. By allowing Southern states to produce and sell carbon credits into the Kyoto Protocol's compliance market, many predicted a growing North-South transfer of carbon finance, technology and profit. Confronted by deep crisis in global carbon markets, however, the cdm, rather than spurring development, is furnishing the conditions for rising debt and insecurity since project costs must be financed upfront, with the expectation that future project revenue will subsequently fulfil these obligations. This paper analyses the dialectic entanglements between the cdm's ex post and market-dependent financing structure, the carbon market crisis and uneven development, based on the contention that cdm-related debt reveals the deeply unequal power relations that underpin contemporary approaches to climate change mitigation, whereby the North's ecological debt is displaced, both materially and financially, onto Southern actors.									9	0	0	0	0	9	0	36	0143-6597	1360-2241		WOS:000319651600007		J	Agostinho, Feni; Ortega, Enrique				Agostinho, Feni DR/C-9351-2018	Agostinho, Feni DR/0000-0002-6445-2175			Energetic-environmental assessment of a scenario for Brazilian cellulosic ethanol								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				47				474	489		10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.05.025				MAY 2013	2013	The end of the age of cheap oil and global warming are causing worldwide concerns about energy security and climate change mitigation. Recognizing that the continuous growth paradigm will not change at short to medium time periods, alternative energy sources to fossil fuels are being sought, in which a promising source seems to be that obtained from vegetal biomass. Specifically in Brazil, there are Conventional Ethanol Plants (CEP) using sugarcane, but due to the energy versus food debate and an increasing demand for ethanol, cellulosic ethanol produced by Biorefineries seems to be a viable option. The question is whether the Biorefinery is more sustainable than CEP. This work aims to assess the energetic-environmental performance of a Biorefinery scenario in Brazil, comparing its results against CEP and another alternative small-scale system. For this, a multi-criteria approach was considered through the following methodologies: Embodied Energy Analysis, Ecological Rucksack, Emergy Accounting and Gas Emission Inventory. Results show that Biorefinery scenario has better rating than CEP for the most indicators when the functional unit is mass of ethanol produced, but when dealing with overall system performance, the Biorefinery performance worse. Neither the Biorefinery nor CEP was superior for all indicators, showing the existence of a trade-off. On the other hand, the small-scale system suggests being the best alternative if the aim is to get higher energetic-environmental performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate influences the global distribution of sea turtle nesting								GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY				22	5			555	566		10.1111/geb.12025				MAY 2013	2013	Aim To understand whether climate limits current sea turtle nesting distributions and shapes the ecological niche of the terrestrial life-history stage of these wide-ranging marine vertebrates. Location Coastlines world-wide. Methods I predicted the spatial distributions of nesting habitat under current climatic conditions for seven sea turtle species using information criteria and maximum entropy modelling. I also compared niche similarity among species using three niche metrics: I, Schoener's D and relative rank. Results Sea turtles currently nest across their entire bioclimatic envelopes, with up to six species predicted to nest on a single beach. The Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Australasia support high nesting diversity, with most regional areas supporting three to five species. Despite large overlap in nesting distributions among species, loggerhead and green turtles have the broadest environmental niches, while Kemp's ridley and flatback turtles have very narrow niches. Main conclusions The terrestrial nesting habitat of sea turtles is characterized by distinct climatic conditions, which are linked to the physical conditions necessary for eggs to hatch successfully and allow hatchlings to disperse from natal areas. Despite broad geographic patterns of overlap and similar embryonic tolerances to temperature and moisture among species, sea turtles partition habitat by nesting in different niche spaces. The tight link between current geographic patterns of nesting and climate, along with the dependence of developing embryos on nest microclimate, imply that regional or global changes in environmental conditions could differentially influence the distribution of sea turtle species under climate change. This could influence the adaptive potential of different populations, and predicting these responses before they occur will be important in mitigating the effects of climate change.									37	0	0	32	1	38	1	278	1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000317673200004		J	Wickham, James D.; Wade, Timothy G.; Riitters, Kurt H.

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that US temperate forests reduce surface temperatures. Location The continental United States. Methods Ordinary least squares regression was used to develop relationships between forest extent and surface temperature. Forest extent was derived from the 900m2 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001) and surface temperature data were from the MODIS 1 km2 8-day composite (MYD11A2). Forestsurface temperature relationships were developed for winter, spring, summer, autumn and annually using 5 years of MODIS land surface temperature data (200711) across six spatial scales (1, 4, 9, 16, 25 and 36 km2). Regression models controlled for the effects of elevation, aspect and latitude (by constraining the regressions within a 1 degrees range). Results We did not find any significant positive slopes in regressions of average annual surface temperatures versus the proportion of forest, indicating that forests are not a source of heat relative to other types of land cover. We found that surface temperatures declined as the proportion of forest increased for spring, summer, autumn and annually. The forestsurface temperature relationship was also scale dependent in that spatially extensive forests produced cooler surface temperatures than forests that were dominant only locally. Main conclusions Our results are not consistent with most scenario-based climate modelling studies. Because of their warming potential, the value of temperate afforestation as a potential climate change mitigation strategy is unclear. Our results indicate that temperate afforestation is a climate change mitigation strategy that should be implemented to promote spatially extensive forests.									17	0	0	5	0	17	1	41	1466-822X			WOS:000317673200010		J	Zhao, Gang; Bryan, Brett A.; King, Darran; Luo, Zhongkui; Wang, Enli; Song, Xiaodong; Yu, Qiang				Luo, Zhongkui/D-1628-2011; Wang, Enli/K-7478-2012; Luo, Zhongkui/B-8125-2008; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; King, Darran A/G-3996-2011; Bryan, Brett Anthony/F-8949-2010	Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0003-0721-096X; Wang, Enli/0000-0002-6653-5791; Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0002-6744-6491; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Bryan, Brett Anthony/0000-0003-4834-5641			Impact of agricultural management practices on soil organic carbon: simulation of Australian wheat systems								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				19	5			1585	1597		10.1111/gcb.12145				MAY 2013	2013	Quantifying soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics at a high spatial and temporal resolution in response to different agricultural management practices and environmental conditions can help identify practices that both sequester carbon in the soil and sustain agricultural productivity. Using an agricultural systems model (the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator), we conducted a high spatial resolution and long-term (122years) simulation study to identify the key management practices and environmental variables influencing SOC dynamics in a continuous wheat cropping system in Australia's 96million ha cereal-growing regions. Agricultural practices included five nitrogen application rates (0200kgNha1 in 50kgNha1 increments), five residue removal rates (0100% in 25% increments), and five residue incorporation rates (0100% in 25% increments). We found that the change in SOC during the 122-year simulation was influenced by the management practices of residue removal (linearly negative) and fertilization (nonlinearly positive) and the environmental variables of initial SOC content (linearly negative) and temperature (nonlinearly negative). The effects of fertilization were strongest at rates up to 50kgNha1, and the effects of temperature were strongest where mean annual temperatures exceeded 19 degrees C. Reducing residue removal and increasing fertilization increased SOC in most areas except Queensland where high rates of SOC decomposition caused by high temperature and soil moisture negated these benefits. Management practices were particularly effective in increasing SOC in south-west Western Australia an area with low initial SOC. The results can help target agricultural management practices for increasing SOC in the context of local environmental conditions, enabling farmers to contribute to climate change mitigation and sustaining agricultural production.									56	3	0	43	0	59	6	136	1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000317284700022	23504769	J	Scrieciu, S.; Rezai, A.; Mechler, R.

The core of the argument is that the growth of modern economies may be sustained or even augmented, while policy intervention simultaneously ensures sustained environmental stewardship and improved social outcomes. But how well are these claims scientifically grounded or supported by economic theory, evidence, and applied modeling? We address this question with reference to the economic modeling of climate mitigation policies. We argue that orthodox economic equilibrium and optimization thinking offers, in effect, little support to and insufficiently meaningful interpretations of green growth claims. There are several exciting strands of new economic thinking that are emerging, offering a more robust and empirically validated understanding of the potential for green growth paths. Nonoptimizing simulation models are arguably in a better position to capture socioeconomic system dynamics and the role of macroeconomic policies for sustainability governance. An important caveat, nevertheless, is that when judged against the evidence, greening growth remains to some extent an oxymoron as to date there has been little evidence of substantial decoupling of GDP from carbon-intensive energy use on a wide scale. Moreover, although the rhetoric on 'greening the economy' actively supports the need for policy intervention, the macroeconomic reasoning behind this, remains ambiguous. We finally suggest that, although focusing on the dichotomy between growth and the environment is clearly important, the quality of growth and beyond growth dimensions are at least as important for delivering improved macroeconomic governance for sustainability.

This paper evaluates a new government-led scheme in Wales, which is intended to increase woodland cover from 14% to 20% by 2030 to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. As the scheme is primarily intended to promote woodland creation on farms, the analysis of the paper focusses upon the question of how to incentivise farmers, and the reasons why difficulties have been experienced engaging land owners in the scheme. Whilst a number of recommendations are made from this policy evaluation, the paper also demonstrates that key lessons have not been applied from existing literature on farmers' behaviour and environmental scheme uptake, and that policy makers are not integrating practice across departmental divisions. As such, the paper suggests that the new focus on carbon sequestration has acted as a distraction to the development of a more robust governance strategy that builds on previous successes and failures in agri-environment policy.

Global health action				6				20816	20816		10.3402/gha.v6i0.20816				2013 Apr 03	2013	BACKGROUND: The observational evidence of the impacts of climate conditions on human health is accumulating. A variety of direct, indirect, and systemically mediated health effects have been identified. Excessive daily heat exposures create direct effects, such as heat stroke (and possibly death), reduce work productivity, and interfere with daily household activities. Extreme weather events, including storms, floods, and droughts, create direct injury risks and follow-on outbreaks of infectious diseases, lack of nutrition, and mental stress. Climate change will increase these direct health effects. Indirect effects include malnutrition and under-nutrition due to failing local agriculture, spread of vector-borne diseases and other infectious diseases, and mental health and other problems caused by forced migration from affected homes and workplaces. Examples of systemically mediated impacts on population health include famine, conflicts, and the consequences of large-scale adverse economic effects due to reduced human and environmental productivity. This article highlights links between climate change and non-communicable health problems, a major concern for global health beyond 2015.DISCUSSION: Detailed regional analysis of climate conditions clearly shows increasing temperatures in many parts of the world. Climate modelling indicates that by the year 2100 the global average temperature may have increased by 34°C unless fundamental reductions in current global trends for greenhouse gas emissions are achieved. Given other unforeseeable environmental, social, demographic, and geopolitical changes that may occur in a plus-4-degree world, that scenario may comprise a largely uninhabitable world for millions of people and great social and military tensions.CONCLUSION: It is imperative that we identify actions and strategies that are effective in reducing these increasingly likely threats to health and well-being. The fundamental preventive strategy is, of course, climate change mitigation by significantly reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, especially long-acting carbon dioxide (CO(2)), and by increasing the uptake of CO(2) at the earth's surface. This involves urgent shifts in energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, energy conservation in building design and urban planning, and reduced waste of energy for transport, building heating/cooling, and agriculture. It would also involve shifts in agricultural production and food systems to reduce energy and water use particularly in meat production. There is also potential for prevention via mitigation, adaptation, or resilience building actions, but for the large populations in tropical countries, mitigation of climate change is required to achieve health protection solutions that will last.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		1654-9880		MEDLINE:23561024	23561024	J	Pittel, Karen; Ruebbelke, Dirk				Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Rubbelke, Dirk/M-5604-2013	Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Rubbelke, Dirk/0000-0002-9934-8570			International Climate Finance and Its Influence on Fairness and Policy								WORLD ECONOMY				36	4			419	436		10.1111/twec.12029				APR 2013	2013	Besides costs and benefits, fairness aspects tend to influence negotiating parties' willingness to join an international agreement on climate change mitigation. Fairness is largely considered to improve the prospects of success of international negotiations and hence measures raising fairness perception might in turn help to bring about effective cooperative international climate change mitigation. We consider the influences present international support of climate policy in developing countries exerts on fairness perception and how this again might affect international negotiations. In doing so we distinguish between fairness perception that is based on historical experiences and perception that is based on conjectures about opponents' intentions. By identifying beneficial components of current support schemes lessons can be learnt for designing new schemes like the Green Climate Fund.									15	1	0	0	1	15	1	40	0378-5920	1467-9701		WOS:000317127800004		J	Lee, Duk Hee; Park, Sang Yong; Hong, Jong Chul; Choi, Sang Jin; Kim, Jong Wook				Lee, Duk Hee/C-1764-2011	Lee, Duk Hee/0000-0002-9962-3595			Analysis of the energy and environmental effects of green car deployment by an integrating energy system model with a forecasting model								APPLIED ENERGY				103				306	316		10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.09.046				MAR 2013	2013	By 2020, Korea has set itself the challenging target of reducing nationwide greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, more than the BAU (Business as Usual) scenario, as the implementation goal required to achieve the new national development paradigm of green growth. To achieve such a target, it is necessary to diffuse innovative technologies with the capacity to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To that end, the ripple effect of diffusing innovative technologies on the energy and environment must be quantitatively analyzed using an energy system analysis model such as the MARKAL (Market Allocation) model. However, energy system analysis models based on an optimization methodology have certain limitations in that a technology with superior cost competitiveness dominates the whole market and non-cost factors cannot be considered. Therefore, this study proposes a new methodology for overcoming problems associated with the use of MARKAL models, by interfacing with a forecasting model based on the discrete-choice model. The new methodology was applied to green car technology to verify its usefulness and to study the ripple effects of green car technology on greenhouse gas reduction. The results of this study can be used as a reference when establishing a strategy for effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, and could be of assistance to future studies using the energy system analysis model.

It may, in addition, be a valuable soil fertility enhancer for agricultural purposes in sandy and/or weathered soils. A life cycle assessment including ecological, health and resource impacts has been conducted for field sites in Zambia to evaluate the overall impacts of biochar for agricultural use. The life cycle impacts from conservation farming using cultivation growth basins and precision fertilization with and without biochar addition were in the present study compared to conventional agricultural methods. Three different biochar production methods were evaluated: traditional earth-mound kilns, improved retort kilns, and micro top-lit updraft (TLUD) gasifier stoves. The results confirm that the use of biochar in conservation farming is beneficial for climate change mitigation purposes. However, when including health impacts from particle emissions originating from biochar production, conservation farming plus biochar from earth-mound kilns generally results in a larger negative effect over the whole life cycle than conservation farming without biochar addition. The use of cleaner technologies such as retort kilns or TLUDs can overcome this problem, mainly because fewer particles and less volatile organic compounds, methane and carbon monoxide are emitted. These results emphasize the need for a holistic view on biochar use in agricultural systems. Of special importance is the biochar production technique which has to be evaluated from both environmental/climate, health and social perspectives.									33	0	0	22	0	34	4	172	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000314675500007	23272937	J	Howell, Rachel A.

Values, motivations, and routes to engagement of people adopting lower-carbon lifestyles								GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS				23	1			281	290		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.10.015				FEB 2013	2013	This exploratory mixed-methods study uses in-depth interviews to investigate the values, motivations, and routes to engagement of UK citizens who have adopted lower-carbon lifestyles. Social justice, community, frugality, and personal integrity were common themes that emerged from the transcripts. Concern about the environment' per se is not the primary motivation for most interviewees' action. Typically, they are more concerned about the plight of poorer people who will suffer from climate change. Although biospheric values are important to the participants, they tended to score altruistic values significantly higher on a survey instrument. Thus, it may not be necessary to promote biospheric values to encourage lower-carbon lifestyles. Participants' narratives of how they became engaged with climate action reveal links to human rights issues and groups as much as environmental organisations and positive experiences in nature. Some interviewees offered very broad (positive) visions of what 'a low-carbon lifestyle' means to them. This, and the fact that 'climate change' is not necessarily seen as interesting even by these highly engaged people, reveals a need for climate change mitigation campaigns to promote a holistic view of a lower-carbon future, rather than simply offering a 'to do' list to 'combat climate change'.

Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment of Winter Maintenance Treatments for Roadways								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE				139	2			138	146		10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000453				FEB 2013	2013	Departments of Transportation (DOTs) rely heavily on chloride-based treatments for winter road maintenance despite the well-documented effects of these chemicals on infrastructure and the environment. Proposed alternative treatments have yet to be widely adopted because of economic and technical limitations that are largely outside of the control of the DOT. This work explores the application of winter maintenance chemicals with a life-cycle approach to understand which actions a DOT can take to reduce the negative life-cycle environmental impacts of these activities. Three representative treatments and/or best management practices are compared: conventional rock salt, calcium magnesium acetate (CMA), and preemptive treatments of roadways with a brine of salt and/or CMA. The results conclusively show that CMA, which has been widely touted as an environmentally preferable, if more expensive, alternative to chloride-based treatments, has considerably higher environmental impacts over its entire life cycle. Most of these burdens are associated with the upstream production processes required to generate the CMA. The salt-based treatments consume considerably less water, energy, and generate fewer greenhouse gases and biochemical oxygen demand in receiving waters. Applying the chloride chemicals as a brine rather than in the dry form results in important reductions in all environmental impacts over the entire life cycle. This result is consistent for a variety of climate conditions (e.g., representative of coastal, piedmont, and mountain climates) considered for this study, which used historical weather data from Virginia. Because DOTs can affect appreciable improvements in efficiency by using brines, sensitivity analysis identifies the activities specifically resulting in the most important environmental improvement on a systems basis. The DOT-controlled steps with the greatest potential for improvement include reducing the energy consumed for the salt application process and implementing practices that reduce total storm water runoff to reduce chloride loading.

It has fair to good reservoir properties and a seal is provided by the mudstones of the Triassic Haisborough Group. It has been folded into domes and periclines (henceforth Bunter domes) by the post depositional late Triassic to Tertiary movement of the underlying evaporites of the Zechstein Group. These domes have been identified as targets for CO2 storage as they are very large and at least some of them have the ability to retain buoyant fluids, demonstrated by the presence of gas fields in some domes [2], [3], [4], [5] (though the majority of the formation is saline water-bearing). However, faults have been identified within the Haisborough Group cap rock directly above a number of the Bunter domes. The faults are thought to have formed as result of extensional stresses exerted during dome formation. They may have an impact on storage site security, as they could act as migration pathways for CO2 out of the storage site and therefore limit the number of Bunter domes that could be utilised for storage of CO2. This study considers the occurrence of faults in the cap rock above the Bunter domes and the potential impact on static capacity estimates. (C) 2013 Natural Environment Research Council.

IEEE					Adapting Building Sector to Climate Change: The Case of Hungary								2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL YOUTH CONFERENCE ON ENERGY (IYCE)															2013	2013	Building sector plays an important role in climate impacts mitigation, as it is responsible for 40% of global energy use and global GHG emissions. Climate change has a dual implication on the built environment: on one hand human settlements and buildings are vulnerable to the effects of changing climate and on the other hand the building sector has a significant climate change mitigation potential.Although nowadays the trends are positive, the share of newly built low-energy buildings is very low, the near-zero-energy building market is in its early phase. Simultaneously the optimizing technologies in the building design are strongly highlighted.The presence of the energy and environment efficient buildings and the stringent building energy regulations of the EU need more accurate building design. The constant design parameters will come to foreground and their role will be appreciated.The relevant sustainable development and building policies, as well as the building design, construction and maintenance should jointly respond both to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. This paper focuses the relevance of the main constant design parameter: How to take into account the increasing outdoor temperature in the building energy design.					4th International Youth Conference on Energy (IYCE)4th International Youth Conference on Energy (IYCE)	JUN 06-08, 2013JUN 06-08, 2013	MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas Co; State Atom Energy Corp Rosatom; Gen Elect; MVM Paks Nucl Power Plant; Budapest Univ Technol & Econ; IEEE BUTE IAS, PES Joint Branch Chapter, Hungary Sect; Assoc Energy Engineers, Hungarian Student Chapter; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc; IEEE Power & Energy SocMOL Hungarian Oil & Gas Co; State Atom Energy Corp Rosatom; Gen Elect; MVM Paks Nucl Power Plant; Budapest Univ Technol & Econ; IEEE BUTE IAS, PES Joint Branch Chapter, Hungary Sect; Assoc Energy Engineers, Hungarian Student Chapter; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc	Siofok, HUNGARYSiofok, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	5			978-1-4673-5556-8	WOS:000341051200032		J	KimInho								Structuring Efficient Domestic Emissions Trading System and Networking with the International Trade Market			국내 배출권거래제도의 효율적 운영과 국제거래시장에의 편입					International Trade Law	통상법률			114				51	81						2013	2013	Climate change is a global concern. Efforts at the global level to reduce greenhouse gases appear stalled due to conflicting political and economic interests. Korea has introduced emissions trading scheme to be implemented in 2015, which would concretize its policy of low carbon green growth to fulfill its responsibility in international community. Emissions trading scheme is a market-based mechanism to internalize the pollution costs externalized to society and the environment. Policy considerations are inevitably interwound in operating emissions trading scheme. Industries complying with emissions trading scheme might take strategic responses to resist or avoid the scheme in fear of relatively weakened competitiveness to their non-complying counterparts. It is time for Korea to remove their concerns and to play a role in international community by operating a robust and reasonable scheme. If policy coherence is ensured across the different policies, the policy goal of greenhouse gas reduction could be efficiently achieved by emissions trading scheme coupled with a policy promoting renewable energy. Emissions trading scheme has been critiqued by some political and business circles. However, the European and U.S. regional experience suggests that once a system is operating it generates some sustaining momentum by itself. The regulated industries also prefer emissions trading scheme to a command and control regulatory system or a pollution tax. The details of the scheme in terms of the laws and regulations should be developed and refined with over time. But it is evident that as markets can play a role in environmental regulation emissions trading scheme will grow internationally. Linkage with other schemes would promote emissions trading across jurisdictions, which enables markets to serve to play a broader role. The aim of emissions trading scheme should be to reduce carbon emissions but at the same time reduce costs. The scheme should embrace both economic growth and environmental benefit. Korean emission trading scheme, which is stable and efficient, linked with other schemes could implement policy goal of low carbon green growth and contribute to greenhouse gas reduction internationally.				기후변화는 전 지구적 문제로 온실가스 감축을 위하여 국제적 노력이 이루어지고 있으나 각 국가의 이해관계가 얽혀 효율적으로 진행되지 못하고 있다. 우리나라도 이와 같은 국제적 노력에 동참하기 위하여 저탄소 녹색성장이라는 정책을 구현하는 하나의 제도로 배출권거래제를 도입하여 2015년 시행을 앞두고 있다. 배출권거래제는 배출권시장이라는 시장기능을 통하여 환경오염을 내부화하는 비용효율적인 제도로 평가되고 있다. 한편 배출권거래제의 운영에는 국가의 정책적 요소가 개재될 수밖에 없다. 배출권거래제의 시행에 있어서 관련 산업체는 국제경쟁력 약화를 염려하여 시행에 저항하거나 회피하는 행태를 보일 우려가 있다. 이러한 산업체의 우려를 불식하고 배출권거래제를 합리적으로 운영함으로써 국제사회에서 책임 있는 국가로서의 역할을 수행할 것이 기대되는 시점이다. 배출권거래제의 시행과 더불어 저탄소 녹색기술의 개발을 지원하는 정책 및 신Â·재생에너지의 확대Â·보급을 위한 정책 등 기후변화정책을 함께 종합적으로 추진한다면 보다 효율적으로 온실가스 감축의 정책목표를 달성할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다. 배출권거래제는 일부 정치권이나 경제계로부터 그 제도적 정착 가능성에 대하여 우려의 시각이 있었으나 유럽연합의 배출권거래제나 미국의 지역 배출권거래제의 시행이 보여주듯 비교적 원활히 정착하고 있으며 규율대상 산업체로부터도 중앙통제적 규율보다는 선호되고 있다. 배출권거래제에 대한 평가는 효율성은 물론 온실가스의 감축이라는 목표의 달성과 규율대상인 사업체와 일반 소비자에 미치는 영향을 종합적으로 고려하여 판단되어야 할 것이다. 배출권거래제의 효율적 정착과 운영을 위하여 이를 운영할 법과 규율은 향후 보완되어 나가야 할 것이나 배출권거래제가 유지Â·발전해 나갈 것임은 분명해 보인다. 또한 배출권거래제 간의 국제연계를 통하여 시장기능이 보다 넓은 영역에서 작용함으로써 배출권거래제의 순기능이 확산될 수 있기를 기대해 본다. 배출권거래제가 비용효율적으로 온실가스 감축을 달성하여야만 즉 경제성장과 환경보호를 동시에 달성하여야 지지를 받을 수 있을 것이다. 우리나라에서 배출권거래제가 효율적으로 정착Â·운영되고 나아가 국제 탄소시장에 편입됨으로써 우리나라의 저탄소 녹색성장이라는 정책목표를 실현하며 또한 국제적으로 온실가스 감축에 기여할 수 있기를 기대한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1598-4915			KJD:ART001827846		J	oh, Kim Tae; 박영수; 조영혁								Analysis of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Potentials in a ElectronicÂ·Electrical components company using LEAP Model			LEAP 모형을 활용한 전자소재Â·부품업의 온실가스 감축 잠재량 분석					Journal of Environmental Impact Assessment	환경영향평가			22	6			667	676		10.14249/eia.2013.22.6.667				2013	2013	This study analyzed the energy demand, greenhouse gas emission and greenhouse gas reduction potential of ElectronicÂ·Electrical components company. The LEAP model targeting long term energy plan was used to establish the most efficient plan for the companies by examining the climate change policy of government and the countermeasures by companies. A scenario was created by having 11 greenhouse gases reduction plans to be introduced from 2011 as the basic plan. Regarding input data, energy consumption by business place and by use, number of employee from 2009 to 2012, land area and change in number of business places were utilized. The study result suggested that approximately 13,800 TJ of energy will be spent in 2020, which is more than 2 times of 2012 energy consumption. When the integrated scenario based on the reduction plan of companies would be enforced, approximately 3,000 TJ will be reduced in 2020.

Discernible human influence now also extend to other aspects of climate including the earth and ocean warming continental average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns. Therefore, mitigation steps and actions that the countries of the world can take to mitigate the effects of climate change. In the tourism sector, greenhouse gas is particularly relevant on emission of carbon(CO2) from aviation and hotel lodging accommodation, which it has an enhanced impact on global warming. Tourism industry consists of activities which produce goods and services to measure, prevent, limit, minimize environmental damage to water, air and soil problems related to waste, noise and building environment. Accordingly the climate change mitigation relates to technological, economic and effectiveness of the industrial sector that lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.Result of this study are summarized as follows.First, the basic approach on th methodology of green tourism management should adapt implementation to the tourism industry. Second, the climate mitigation potential is thought to be relatively high in the tourism industry sector because efforts to lower energy consumption greenhouse gas emission in the sector. Third, this study found that virtually all sources of renewable energy are relevant for tourism industry, including wind power, solar thermal, geothermal power, biomass and energy regeneration from waste. Forth, the method of green tourism management have to establish promotional action plan for green consumption, green business management and Eco-label for tourist accommodation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1229-3482			KJD:ART001758940		J	Lee, DongKun; Lee, Hochul; Sangyeon, Hwang; 김은영; 김영자								Introduction of Soil Network(Gold Network) as one of the Ecological Network			생태네트워크로서의 토양네트워크(Gold Network) 제안					Journal of the Korea Society of Environmental Restoration Technology	한국환경복원기술학회지			16	1			245	257						2013	2013	Lately, besides promoting the biodiversity of the natural ecosystems, there is a demand for climate change mitigation features that will reduce greenhouse gases and prevent disasters that will bring damages such as torrential rains. However, there was not a lot of discussion on the soils that are key in these features. Therefore, this paper proposes a network (Gold Network) as an alternative that will solve the problem that was filed earlier by figuring out how to compose the soil environment. First, in order to maximize the ecological status and value of the soil, a soil network can be proposed through the vertical and horizontal connections of the fragmented soil. Second, there is a need to understand and research the organic system of the ecosystems as well as the complex perspective of the ecosystem services, not only the fragmentary perspectives of the soil remediation, planting improvements or the other existing elements. Third, there is a need to apply the integrated perspective of the Landscape Ecology, Ecological Engineering and Restoration Ecology for the connectivity of the soil (network) due to it being in the execution of the soil network. If a soil network was to be built, a fundamental ecological network would be realized to not only promote biodiversity but also to prepare effective adaptation to climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1229-3032			KJD:ART001746320		S	Kaklauskas, A.; Kliukas, R.; Komka, A.; Sliogeriene, J.

Heat Treating Equipment and Hardware Materials; Energy and Environment; Processes and Heat-Treated Materials Technology have been identified as three important factors for energy cost reduction. Electricity, Light Fuel Oil, LPG, and CNG are the main sources of energy applied in the Thai heat treatment industry. Continuous increases in global energy costs and heightened awareness in climate change mitigation has given rise to efforts for energy conservation in the industry.

Social and technical changes are however intimately related, and consumption entangled with technology. Design researchers have proposed several strategies for facilitating more sustainable consumption patterns through design. However, many actors and structures influence both technology development and how consumption patterns evolve. Understanding the preconditions for design-led contribution requires looking beyond the designer-product-user triad. To frame further investigation into the role of design in transformation of consumption, theoretical concepts from the social sciences are introduced.

Climate change threats to population health and well-being: the imperative of protective solutions that will last								GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION				6				1	9	20816	10.3402/gha.v6i0.20816				2013	2013	Background: The observational evidence of the impacts of climate conditions on human health is accumulating. A variety of direct, indirect, and systemically mediated health effects have been identified. Excessive daily heat exposures create direct effects, such as heat stroke (and possibly death), reduce work productivity, and interfere with daily household activities. Extreme weather events, including storms, floods, and droughts, create direct injury risks and follow-on outbreaks of infectious diseases, lack of nutrition, and mental stress. Climate change will increase these direct health effects. Indirect effects include malnutrition and under-nutrition due to failing local agriculture, spread of vector-borne diseases and other infectious diseases, and mental health and other problems caused by forced migration from affected homes and workplaces. Examples of systemically mediated impacts on population health include famine, conflicts, and the consequences of large-scale adverse economic effects due to reduced human and environmental productivity. This article highlights links between climate change and non-communicable health problems, a major concern for global health beyond 2015.Discussion: Detailed regional analysis of climate conditions clearly shows increasing temperatures in many parts of the world. Climate modelling indicates that by the year 2100 the global average temperature may have increased by 3-4 degrees C unless fundamental reductions in current global trends for greenhouse gas emissions are achieved. Given other unforeseeable environmental, social, demographic, and geopolitical changes that may occur in a plus-4-degree world, that scenario may comprise a largely uninhabitable world for millions of people and great social and military tensions.Conclusion: It is imperative that we identify actions and strategies that are effective in reducing these increasingly likely threats to health and well-being. The fundamental preventive strategy is, of course, climate change mitigation by significantly reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, especially long-acting carbon dioxide (CO2), and by increasing the uptake of CO2 at the earth's surface. This involves urgent shifts in energy production from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, energy conservation in building design and urban planning, and reduced waste of energy for transport, building heating/cooling, and agriculture. It would also involve shifts in agricultural production and food systems to reduce energy and water use particularly in meat production. There is also potential for prevention via mitigation, adaptation, or resilience building actions, but for the large populations in tropical countries, mitigation of climate change is required to achieve health protection solutions that will last.									40	0	0	15	0	40	3	171	1654-9880			WOS:000317110000001		J	Panagos, Panos; Ballabio, Cristiano; Yigini, Yusuf; Dunbar, Martha B.

Moreover, the estimation of soil organic carbon content is of crucial importance for soil protection and for climate change mitigation strategies.Soil organic carbon is one of the attributes of the recently developed LUCAS soil database. The request for data on soil organic carbon and other soil attributes arose from an on-going debate about efforts to establish harmonized datasets for all EU countries with data on soil threats in order to support modeling activities and display variations in these soil conditions across Europe.In 2009, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre conducted the LUCAS soil survey, sampling ca. 20,000 points across 23 EU member states. This article describes the results obtained from analyzing the soil organic carbon data in the LUCAS soil database. The collected data were compared with the modeled European topsoil organic carbon content data developed at the JRC. The best fitted comparison was performed at NUTS2 level and showed underestimation of modeled data in southern Europe and overestimation in the new central eastern member states. There is a good correlation in certain regions for countries such as the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Italy, Ireland, and France. Here we assess the feasibility of producing comparable estimates of the soil organic carbon content at NUTS2 regional level for the European Union (EU27) and draw a comparison with existing modeled data. In addition to the data analysis, we suggest how the modeled data can be improved in future updates with better calibration of the model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, buildings utilize up to one-third of total global energy in carrying out its function and it has been identified as a key potential contributor to efforts to enhance security of energy supplies, reduce greenhouse emission and mitigate climate change. Towards achieving this, the use of computational intelligence and behaviour based systems in particular multi-agent systems (MAS) have been proposed for use in building comfort and energy management systems (BECMS) to achieve energy savings as well as improved user satisfaction. However its application in BECMs of large commercial buildings is still very limited. This paper provides a survey of MAS frameworks existing in literature. In addition, insight into some implementation challenges as well as discussion on integrating user behaviour which is a crucial factor pivotal to achieving both comfort and energy savings.					4th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications (ISDEA)4th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Engineering Applications (ISDEA)	NOV 06-07, 2013NOV 06-07, 2013	Cent S Univ; St Johns Univ; Hunan Univ Technol, Dept Elect Sci & Technol; Natl Univ Defense Technol; Intelligent Computat Technol & Automat SociCent S Univ; St Johns Univ; Hunan Univ Technol, Dept Elect Sci & Technol; Natl Univ Defense Technol; Intelligent Computat Technol & Automat Soci	Zhangjiajie, PEOPLES R CHINAZhangjiajie, PEOPLES R CHINA	2	0	0	0	0	2	0	7			978-1-4799-2791-3	WOS:000346143900165		B	Imteaz, M.

In addition to these benefits, United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and Ramsar Convention defined wetlands to be of biosphere significance and societal importance in the areas of shoreline stabilisation, storm protection, cultural values, recreation and tourism, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Wetlands are also considered the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. The function of most natural wetland systems is not to treat wastewater, however, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental scientists who specialize in the area of wastewater treatment.In the past wetlands used to be in place naturally and used to provide ecological benefits to the mankind and environment. Through recognizing their immense benefits, human being started to construct artificial wetlands. Recently, constructed wetlands are recommended as one of the salient features of water sensitive urban design, which play an important role in water management and ecologically sustainable development. These constructed artificial wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to help in treating wastewater effluent. Artificial wetlands provide the ability to experiment with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and flora in order to produce the most efficient treatment process.Constructed wetlands are increasingly being designed and used to treat wastewaters. Majority of constructed wetlands are designed based on steady-state releases of pollutants loading. However, in some cases (i.e. aquaculture ponds) pollutant loadings are not steady-state, rather are intermittent. Pollutants transport analysis based on steady-state release (inflow) will be quite different from an analysis based on intermittent loading/inflow. In the past several studies were conducted on pollutants transport and degradation through wetlands using steady-state inflow of pollutants. In this paper, a simple numerical model is proposed and developed based on conservation of mass principle for the pollutants and transport through a wetland, considering a series of tanks. Tank-in-series approach assumes that the wetland is comprised of several interconnected tanks, each of which can be modeled as a continuous flow stirred tank reactor. As for pollutants, in this study organic matters are considered. Same numerical model can be used for different organic matters, considering different values of degradation rate. Using first-order kinetic equations of pollutants transport and degradation and applying Euler's method of difference equations a numerical model was developed. Developed numerical model can simulate pollutant transport and degradations for steadystate, continuous and/or irregular/intermittent pollutant loadings. Numerical model results were verified with earlier developed analytical solutions for intermittent pollutant loadings, which were applied for aquaculture ponds in Texas (USA). Numerical model results are close to the results derived from analytical solutions for the same condition. Reasons of some primary discrepancies are discussed. Developed numerical model was used to present different scenario using different flow rates, pond volumes and different masses of intermittent pollutants. It is found that all of these parameters have significant impact on outflow pollutants' concentrations.					20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013DEC 01-06, 2013	CSIRO; Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; GOYDER Inst; Govt S Australia; Australian Math Soc; Australian Math Sci Inst; Simulat Australia; Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl MathCSIRO; Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math; Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol; GOYDER Inst; Govt S Australia; Australian Math Soc; Australian Math Sci Inst; Simulat Australia; Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math	Adelaide, AUSTRALIAAdelaide, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	8			978-0-9872143-3-1	WOS:000357105902107		S	Taisch, Marco; Stahl, Bojan						Emmanouilidis, C; Taisch, M; Kiritsis, D		Requirements Analysis and Definition for Eco-factories: The Case of EMC2								ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS: COMPETITIVE MANUFACTURING FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AMPS 2012, PT I		IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology		397				111	118						2013	2013	Climate change mitigation and the EU2020 strategy foster energy efficiency in Europe's future manufacturing landscape. These challenges make high demands to SMEs as well to MNCs. The paper gives insight to an approach on Eco-factories based on the EU-funded FP7 project EMC2. Eco-factories will enable the quantum leap in integrating environmental issues in brownfield and greenfield factory planning and factory operation. The paper focuses on the identification, structuring and definition of requirements for Eco-factory simulation approaches. Requirements for developing a simulation environment for integrating energy and material flows for detailed analysis but also wide user spectrum is presented. The paper shows that demands are twofold requesting integrated, modular and detailed simulation solutions as well as emphasize on user-friendliness and low complexity.

Air quality encompasses the here-and-now of pollutant emissions, atmospheric transformations and their direct effect on human and ecosystem health. Climate change deals with the drivers leading to a warmer world and the consequences of that. These two science and policy issues are inexorably linked via common pollutants, such as ozone (methane) and black carbon. This short review looks at the new scientific evidence around so-called "short-lived climate forcers" and the growing realisation that a way to meet short-term climate change targets may be through the control of "air quality" pollutants. None of the options discussed here can replace reduction of long-lived greenhouse gases, such as CO2, which is required for any long-term climate change mitigation strategy. An overview is given of the underlying science, remaining uncertainties, and some of the synergies and trade-offs for addressing air quality and climate in the science and policy context.									11	0	0	3	0	11	4	55	2050-7887			WOS:000320936400002	23743609	B	Dineva, Slava				Dineva, Slava I/I-5388-2018		Ozhan, E		Regional-Level Impacts of Climate Change on the Black Sea								GLOBAL CONGRESS ON ICM: LESSONS LEARNED TO ADDRESS NEW CHALLENGES, VOLS. 1 AND 2								635	644						2013	2013	The sea water plays fundamental role in the climate regulation cycle. Sea water environment issues transcend national boundaries and concerted actions are necessary to ensure effective protection. Regional-level climate change impact assessment on the 10-mile Black Sea zone in front of the Bulgarian coast is based on research in 2009. Overall view of sea surface temperature (SST) throughout the Black Sea and SST in the global context and highlights are produced, as well. Study was performed in front of Cape Galata at 1, 3, and 10 miles offshore. Bulgarian coastal zone in front of Cape Galata is under a process of warming throughout the surface-bottom layer. Considering that Bulgarian Black Sea is under influence of the Danube's stream, coastal zone in front of Cape Galata is under a process of increase in salinity throughout the surfawce-bottom layer. As expected outcomes of these processes, animals, plants, and bacteria will migrate to new areas with favourable climate conditions. Certain species will be able to invade areas that they did not previously inhabit. Ecosystems will continue to be disturbed by climate change. Changes in the climate conditions can affect the health and function of the ecosystems and the survival of entire species. A number of human activities are releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and changing the balance of the climate system. Greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years or for thousands of years before being removed by natural processes and their warming influence is projected to persist into the next century, therefore scientific, technological and policy measures against global warming is much needed. Climate change mitigation has to include reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and enhancing the sinks that remove them from the atmosphere, whereas adaptation refers to actions performed at local or regional scale to moderate negative effects of climate change. Climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for the Black Sea region are needed. Humans may be able to mitigate climate change or lessen its severity. Strategies have to involve shifting from carbon to renewable energy sources, building new infrastructure for alternative energy sources, innovative research and basic change in the way humans use energy.

In developing the system design and specifications of an environmentally friendly vehicle, various simulations have been performed on the different components and the overall system. Although a precise modelling of each part and the system as a whole is necessary for an accurate simulation, detailed modelling of a high-capacity battery system - which directly affects the performance of an environmentally friendly vehicle - is difficult to achieve owing to the non-linear electrochemical properties of the battery. In this study, an electrochemical impedance measurement technique is used to implement a battery cell model, upon which a battery system model for environmentally friendly vehicles that takes into account the ancillary components of the battery pack is developed. And we used an actual battery system that requires complex and difficult modelling owing to non-linear and irreversible properties of the battery. In addition, to verify the developed battery system model, we used models implemented for other vehicle components and systems to construct a hardware-in-the-loop simulation of a battery reflecting an actual driving environment.									13	0	0	0	0	13	0	3	1755-4535	1755-4543		WOS:000321705900020		J	Bernardes, Luis Felix; Carneiro, Julio; de Abreu, Manuel Pinto				Carneiro, Julio F/B-6348-2016	Carneiro, Julio F/0000-0002-4900-3355			CO2 hydrates as a climate change mitigation strategy: definition of stability zones in the Portuguese deep offshore								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING				5	2			135	151		10.1504/IJGW.2013.053495				2013	2013	Storage of CO2 as hydrates in sub-seabed sediments has been indicated as an alternative solution for the geological storage of CO2, suitable for offshore areas where large ocean depths and low temperatures exist at short distance from the shore. This paper presents the works conducted to identify the CO2 hydrates stability zone, i.e., the areas where CO2 hydrates may form and remain stable, in the deep offshore of Portugal. The methodology involved building maps of geothermal gradient, seabed temperature, detailed bathymetry and conversion to hydrostatic pressure, and maps of sediment thickness. These data were integrated in a GIS environment and a Fortran code was implemented to compute the thickness of the hydrate stability zone, based on the pressure and the temperature conditions in the sub-seabed sediments. Preferential areas, where further studies should be conducted, are delineated.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	23	1758-2083	1758-2091		WOS:000320833600003		J	Langlois, Etienne V.; Campbell, Kathryn; Prieur-Richard, Anne-Helene; Karesh, William B.; Daszak, Peter				daszak, peter/U-4588-2017	daszak, peter/0000-0002-2046-5695			Towards a Better Integration of Global Health and Biodiversity in the New Sustainable Development Goals Beyond Rio+20								ECOHEALTH				9	4			381	385		10.1007/s10393-012-0800-8				DEC 2012	2012	In June 2012, Brazil hosted Rio+20, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) marking the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Earth Summit. The Rio+20 outcome document entitled The future we want provides general guidance to shape sustainable development policies, but fell short of providing legally binding agreements or pragmatic goals. Negotiators agreed to develop a process for the establishment of new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), building upon the Millennium Development Goals, and setting the foundation for the post-2015 UN development agenda. Our objective is to argue that discussions beyond Rio+20 and toward the adoption of SDGs offer a critical opportunity to re-assess the major challenges for global health and sustainable development. There is an urgent need to translate the general aspirations put forth by Rio+20 into concrete health outcomes and greater health equity. The way toward the post-2015 SDGs will likely be more effective if it highlights the full gamut of linkages between ecosystem processes, anthropogenic environmental changes (climate change, biodiversity loss, and land use), socio-economic changes, and global health. Negotiations beyond Rio+20 should strongly acknowledge the global health benefits of biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, which reduce diseases of poverty and protect the health of the most vulnerable. We argue that health and ecosystems are inextricably linked to all development sectors and that health should remain a critical priority for the upcoming SDGs in the context of global environmental change.									13	0	0	3	0	13	2	50	1612-9202			WOS:000317970500005	23001330	J	Adebamowo, Mike; Ilesanmi, Adetokunbo O.								STUDY OF BUILDING ADAPTATION IN WARM HUMID CLIMATE IN NIGERIA								OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL				37	4			72	80						DEC 2012	2012	Buildings have a considerable impact on the environment being responsible for a substantial proportion of global energy consumption, thus contributing significantly to the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which evidence suggests is the main cause of climate change. Mitigation and adaptation measures are required to tackle the challenges of climate change. Adaptive measures - structural and behavioural strategies - are the focus of this paper. Structural strategies include flexible and adaptive structural systems; while behavioural strategies cover the spatial, personal, and psychological control measures which may influence the design and operations of buildings. The study explores the adaptive thermal comfort of occupants and examines the design strategies for adapting buildings to climate change in the tropical context, with a view to determine the effectiveness of these strategies as observed in the case study. The study was conducted during the rainy and dry seasons in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria, located in a warm humid climate zone.The Institute of Venture Design student hostel was used as case-study to conduct the survey on a sample of 40 respondents by means of structured questionnaire. The respondents' thermal sensation and access to thermal controls were determined, and their thermal sensation and thermal adaptability in both seasons comparatively analyzed. Indoor environmental parameters including air temperature, mean radiant temperature, relative humidity and air velocity were also measured. The data were analyzed using relevant descriptive and inferential statistics. The study discussed the effectiveness of design strategies available for building adaptation in an era of climate change within the warm humid environment, concluding on the need for greater synergy between the techno-structural and socio-behavioural dimensions of building adaptation.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	8	0168-2601			WOS:000313387800008		J	Patrick, Rebecca; Capetola, Teresa; Townsend, Mardie; Nuttman, Sonia				Nuttman, Sonia/K-3290-2017	Nuttman, Sonia/0000-0001-9078-9559			Health promotion and climate change: exploring the core competencies required for action								HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL				27	4			475	485		10.1093/heapro/dar055				DEC 2012	2012	Climate change poses serious threats to human health and well-being. It exacerbates existing health inequities, impacts on the social determinants of health and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. In the Australian region these include remote Aboriginal communities, Pacific Island countries and people with low incomes. Given health promotions remit to protect and promote health, it should be well placed to respond to emerging climate-related health challenges. Yet, to date, there has been little evidence to demonstrate this. This paper draws on the findings of a qualitative study conducted in Victoria, Australia to highlight that; while there is clearly a role for health promotion in climate change mitigation and adaptation at the national and international levels, there is also a need for the engagement of health promoters at the community level. This raises several key issues for health promotion practice. To be better prepared to respond to climate change, health promotion practitioners first need to re-engage with the central tenets of the Ottawa Charter, namely the interconnectedness of humans and the natural environment and, secondly, the need to adopt ideas and frameworks from the sustainability field. The findings also open up a discussion for paradigmatic shifts in health promotion thinking and acting in the context of climate change.									18	0	0	2	0	18	0	19	0957-4824	1460-2245		WOS:000311308300007	21914637	J	George, S.

Since the original plant communities were mostly perennial and deep rooted, the model for sustainable agriculture and landscape water management invariably includes deep rooted trees. Commercial forestry is however only economical in higher rainfall (>700 mm yr(-1)) areas whereas much of the area where biodiversity is threatened has lower rainfall (300-700 mm yr(-1)). Agroforestry may provide the opportunity to develop new agricultural landscapes that interlace ecosystem services such as carbon mitigation via carbon sequestration and biofuels, biodiversity restoration, watershed management while maintaining food production. Active markets are developing for some of these ecosystem services, however a lack of predictive metrics and the regulatory environment are impeding the adoption of several ecosystem services. Nonetheless, a clear opportunity exists for four major issues - the maintenance of food and fibre production, salinisation, biodiversity decline and climate change mitigation - to be managed at a meaningful scale and a new, sustainable agricultural landscape to be developed.

The importance of cork agro-forestry systems lies in the fact that a natural and renewable raw material - cork - can be extracted sustainably without endangering the tree or affecting biodiversity. This paper describes an environmental analysis of the extraction of raw cork in cork oak forests in Catalonia, using data from five representative local forest exploitations. The evaluation was carried out using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and all the forestry management required to obtain a tonne of raw cork was included. The aim of the study was to evaluate the environmental impacts - in terms of global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, and so on - caused by cork extraction and determine the carbon dioxide balance of these forestry systems, with a tree lifespan of about 200 years.During the life cycle extraction of cork in Catalonia, 0.2 kg of CO2 eq. was emitted per kg of raw cork extracted. Moreover, cork cannot be extracted without the tree, which will be fixing carbon dioxide throughout its technological useful life (200 years), despite the fact that the bark is removed periodically: every 13-14 years. If the emission from extraction and the carbon contained in the material is discounted, the carbon dioxide balance indicates that 18 kg of CO2 are fixed per kg of raw cork extracted. Therefore, cork is a natural, renewable and local material that can replace other non-renewable materials, at local level, to reduce the environmental impacts of products, and particularly to reduce their carbon footprint.

The overarching objective of the paper is to provide policy guidance on how to facilitate the transformation of the energy system to achieve these multiple energy objectives. Particular focus is given to the required pace of the transformation at both the global and regional levels, and to the types of financial and policy measures that will be needed to ensure a successful transition. Synergies and trade-offs between the objectives are identified, and co-benefits quantified. The paper makes an important contribution to the scenario literature by approaching the global transition toward sustainable development in a more integrated, holistic manner than is common in other studies.									4	0	0	1	0	4	0	14	0165-0203			WOS:000311688900001		J	Lake, Iain R.; Hooper, Lee; Abdelhamid, Asmaa; Bentham, Graham; Boxall, Alistair B.

Altered conditions for food production may result in emerging pathogens, new crop and livestock species, and altered use of pesticides and veterinary medicines, and affect the main transfer mechanisms through which contaminants move from the environment into food. All these have implications for food safety and the nutritional content of food. Climate change mitigation may increase consumption of foods whose production reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts may include reduced red meat consumption (with positive effects on saturated fat, but negative impacts on zinc and iron intake) and reduced winter fruit and vegetable consumption. Developed countries have complex structures in place that may be used to adapt to the food safety consequences of climate change, although their effectiveness will vary between countries, and the ability to respond to nutritional challenges is less certain.CONCLUSIONS: Climate change will have notable impacts upon nutrition and food safety in developed countries, but further research is necessary to accurately quantify these impacts. Uncertainty about future impacts, coupled with evidence that climate change may lead to more variable food quality, emphasizes the need to maintain and strengthen existing structures and policies to regulate food production, monitor food quality and safety, and respond to nutritional and safety issues that arise.									52	0	0	25	1	52	4	252	0091-6765	1552-9924		WOS:000311070000019	23124134	J	Gersbach, Hans; Winkler, Ralph								Global refunding and climate change								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL				36	11			1775	1795		10.1016/j.jedc.2012.06.001				NOV 2012	2012	We design a global refunding scheme as a new international approach to address climate change. Participating in the global refunding system requires an initial payment. It allows each country to set its carbon emission tax, while aggregate tax revenues are partially refunded to member countries in proportion to the relative emission reductions they achieve within a given period. The refunding scheme reduces the intertemporal climate change problem into a static public goods problem. In a simple model we show that a suitably designed global refunding scheme achieves the social global optimum, provided that all countries participate. We discuss several procedures to achieve initial participation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The growing concern on climate change related issues lead to create international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol, and to establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change aimed at studying climate evolution and at defining common actions through the adoption of joint climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. From the time when international Task Forces, projects and programs were shared in order to deal with the reduction of environmental exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), international organisations have also been committed to estimate how climate change may affect POPs' environmental behaviour and distribution. In this review paper, we report the track of POPs' regulation efforts driven towards decreasing POPs' environmental concentrations through reducing or banning POP emissions in the environment. We also report scientific studies on climate change related effects on POPs' environmental behaviour in order to feature how climate change is influencing POPs' fate and transport. Our final aim is to identify how POPs-related regulations may take into account climate change in managing current or future POPs sources. We find in several case studies on this topic that climate change is considered to contribute to enhance POPs' long-range transport and that remote areas are considered likely to be the most impacted by POPs' pollution under a climate change perspective. Our findings also consider that continuous monitoring programs oriented towards the observation of secondary POP sources and the enhancement of inventories reporting primary and secondary POP emissions are useful in dealing with POPs' exposure under climate change scenarios. We also suggest how communication between science and regulation should be driven towards considering climate change effects into chemicals' legislation. (C) Author(s) 2012.

This share is not enough for the country and the governments should be increase to this situation. Renewable energy technologies of wind, biomass, hydropower, geothermal, solar thermal and photovoltaics are finally showing maturity and the ultimate promise of cost competitiveness. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Certain policy interventions could have a dramatic impact on shaping the relationship between geological, geographic and climatic conditions and energy production. This study shows that there is enough renewable energy potential in Turkey for fuels and electricity. Especially hydropower and biomass are very well. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Governance functions for linking climate change mitigation with land use, freshwater and biodiversity protection"								ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS				81				10	20		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.06.020				SEP 2012	2012	Earth system interactions, as highlighted by the planetary boundaries framework, occur within and across natural, social and economic systems and shape global environmental change. This paper addresses the multi-level governance problem of coherently addressing key interactions between four Earth sub-systems - climate change, freshwater use, land use and biodiversity - taking into account concerns over problem shifting. After discussing possibilities for regional downscaling of the boundaries, we explore challenges for the EU region to coherently address this particular set of interacting Earth sub-systems and reduce the risk of problem shifting. This analysis demonstrates that Earth system interactions can be governed, but that they likely require comprehensive packages of governance responses across both sub-systems and levels. Three overarching governance functions are tentatively identified that directly or indirectly address Earth system interactions: reduction of system stress, risks and vulnerabilities; triggering and navigation of transformation of economic activity: and development of a diversity of options. Finally, the paper briefly discusses political and institutional challenges for developing, enabling and stabilising these governance functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Institutional Pressures and an Evolving Forest Carbon Market								BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				21	6			351	369		10.1002/bse.1726				SEP 2012	2012	It is estimated that 87 million acres of forestland in the United States (US) is managed by private industrial forestland owners (nearly 14% of the forestland nationwide). Private industrial forestland owners include forest product companies, Timber Investment Management Organizations (TIMOs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Current regulatory and voluntary carbon markets, as well as proposed national emission reduction legislation, in the US make provisions for substantial carbon offsets from domestic forestry projects. This research employs the theory of planned behavior by means of an online questionnaire in order to survey large industrial forestland owners (>30 000 acres) regarding intentions to manage forestland for carbon sequestration and trading. Quantitative results suggest that very few organizations (18%) were managing forestland for carbon values. Attitudes towards carbon sequestration and trading were significantly influenced by the managers' beliefs that emission reduction legislation would become law and that US forest carbon offsets can be used as a legitimate climate change mitigation tool. Qualitative results revealed that most organizations are taking a passive approach to carbon sequestration and trading until a suitable regulatory framework emerges and carbon prices provide the conditions for a sound investment. The researchers suggest that, given the size and scope of the climate change phenomenon as well as the multifaceted and unified mitigation strategy required to address it, the development of functional carbon markets will be an iterative process and may require a global carbon framework that reflects the globalized nature of the forest economy.

This review presents an overview on the emissions and risk of mercury from fluorescent lamps during production and disposal, and discusses measures for reducing the mercury risk through solid waste management and source reduction. Fluorescent lamps produced in China used to contain relatively large amounts of mercury (up to 40 mg per lamp) due to the prevalence of liquid mercury dosing, which also released significant amounts of mercury to the environment. Upgrade of the mercury dosing technologies and manufacturing facilities had significantly reduced the mercury contents in fluorescent lamps, with most of them containing less than 10 or 5 mg per lamp now. Occupational hygiene studies showed that mercury emissions occurred during fluorescent lamp production, particularly in the facilities using liquid mercury dosing, which polluted the environmental media at and surrounding the production sites and posed chronic health risk to the workers by causing neuropsychological and motor impairments. It is estimated that spent fluorescent lamps account for approximately 20% of mercury input in the MSW in China. Even though recycling of fluorescent lamps presents an important opportunity to capture the mercury they contain, it is difficult and not cost-effective at reducing the mercury risk under the broader context of mercury pollution control in China. In light of the significant mercury emissions associated with electricity generation in China, we propose that reduction of mercury emissions and risk associated with fluorescent lamps should be achieved primarily through lowering their mercury contents by the manufacturers while recycling programs should focus on elemental mercury-containing waste products instead of fluorescent lamps to recapture mercury from the waste stream cost-effectively.

Carbon balance and management				7	1			9	9		10.1186/1750-0680-7-9				2012 Aug 09	2012	BACKGROUND: Several previous global REDD+ cost studies have been conducted, demonstrating that payments for maintaining forest carbon stocks have significant potential to be a cost-effective mechanism for climate change mitigation. These studies have mostly followed highly aggregated top-down approaches without estimating the full range of REDD+ costs elements, thus underestimating the actual costs of REDD+. Based on three REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, representing an area of 327,825 ha, this study explicitly adopts a bottom-up approach to data assessment. By estimating opportunity, implementation, transaction and institutional costs of REDD+ we develop a practical and replicable methodological framework to consistently assess REDD+ cost elements.RESULTS: Based on historical land use change patterns, current region-specific economic conditions and carbon stocks, project-specific opportunity costs ranged between US$ -7.8 and 28.8 tCOxxxx for deforestation and forest degradation drivers such as agriculture, fuel wood production, unsustainable timber extraction and pasture expansion. The mean opportunity costs for the three projects ranged between US$ 10.1 - 12.5 tCO2. Implementation costs comprised between 89% and 95% of total project costs (excluding opportunity costs) ranging between US$ 4.5 - 12.2 tCO2 for a period of 30 years. Transaction costs for measurement, reporting, verification (MRV), and other carbon market related compliance costs comprised a minor share, between US$ 0.21 - 1.46 tCO2. Similarly, the institutional costs comprised around 1% of total REDD+ costs in a range of US$ 0.06 - 0.11 tCO2.CONCLUSIONS: The use of bottom-up approaches to estimate REDD+ economics by considering regional variations in economic conditions and carbon stocks has been shown to be an appropriate approach to provide policy and decision-makers robust economic information on REDD+. The assessment of opportunity costs is a crucial first step to provide information on the economic baseline situation of deforestation and forest degradation agents and on the economic incentives required to halt unsustainable land use. Since performance based REDD+ carbon payments decrease over time (as deforestation rates drop and for each saved ha of forest payments occur once), investments in REDD+ implementation have a crucial role in triggering sustainable land use systems by investing in the underlying assets and the generation of sustainable revenue streams to compensate for opportunity costs of land use change. With a potential increase in the land value due to effective REDD+ investments, expenditures in an enabling institutional environment for REDD+ policies are crucial to avoid higher deforestation pressure on natural forests.									14	0	0	4	0	14	0	9		1750-0680		MEDLINE:22877419	22877419	J	Yuksel, Ibrahim								Global warming and environmental benefits of hydroelectric for sustainable energy in Turkey								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				16	6			3816	3825		10.1016/j.rser.2012.03.028				AUG 2012	2012	Over the last two decades; technical, economic and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries. Turkey has a total gross hydropower potential of 433 GWh/yr, but only 125 GWh/yr of the total hydroelectric potential of Turkey can be economically used. By the commissioning of new hydropower plants, which are under construction, 36% of the economically usable potential of the country would be tapped. Turkey's total economically usable small hydropower potential is 3.75 GWh/yr. It is expected that the demand for electric energy in Turkey will be about 580 billion kWh by the year 2020. Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy sources that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Environmentally friendly energy development has enormous implications for developing countries as major emitters due to their rapid economic and population growth. With some possible options, the paper concludes that the reduction of emissions can only be achieved when policies are supportive and well targeted, standards and incentives are realistic and flexible, and the public is actively responsive to environmental degradation. Turkey's high rate of energy-related carbon emissions growth is expected to accelerate, with emissions climbing from 57 million tons in 2000 to almost 210 million tons in 2020. Carbon intensity in Turkey is higher than the western developed nation average. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. This paper deals with Turkey's renewables energy sources for sustainable environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate these assumptions, using a nationally representative online survey of U.S. residents (N = 1,127) conducted in December, 2010, we randomly assigned six previously identified audience segments on climate change to one of three experimental conditions. Subjects were asked to read uniquely framed news articles about climate change emphasizing either the risks to the environment, public health, or national security and the benefits of mitigation and adaptation-related actions. Results show that across audience segments, the public health focus was the most likely to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Findings also indicated that the national security frame may possibly boomerang among audience segments already doubtful or dismissive of the issue, eliciting unintended feelings of anger.									177	0	1	32	0	177	3	63	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000306337100034		J	Heinonen, Jukka; Saynajoki, Antti-Juhani; Kuronen, Matti; Junnila, Seppo				Junnila, Seppo/G-2269-2013; Heinonen, Jukka/K-6952-2015	Junnila, Seppo/0000-0002-2984-0383; Heinonen, Jukka/0000-0002-7298-4999			Are the Greenhouse Gas Implications of New Residential Developments Understood Wrongly?								ENERGIES				5	8			2874	2893		10.3390/en5082874				AUG 2012	2012	Built environment carbon reduction strategies materialize predominantly in city-level greenhouse gas (GHG) management, where new residential development appears as one of the key instruments. However, city-level assessments are often incapable of producing data at a community or neighborhood level and thus they may heavily underestimate the emissions from new construction. This paper explores the implications of low-energy residential construction as an instrument of climate change mitigation in the built environment and demonstrates why city-level approaches easily fail to identify the significance of the emissions from construction. We employ a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to demonstrate that, when the temporal allocation of emissions from the construction and use phases is taken into account, construction phase emissions come to have a central role in finding effective GHG mitigation strategies-even when the emissions from all consumption activities during the use phase are included in the assessment. In fact, their role would seem to be so central that new residential construction cannot be utilized as an instrument of city carbon management, even over a relatively long period. While we analyze a case study from Finland, the analysis intends to highlight the situation throughout the globe.									11	1	0	1	0	11	0	12	1996-1073			WOS:000308241500015		J	Rockstrom, J.; Falkenmark, M.; Lannerstad, M.; Karlberg, L.

It makes an attempt to assess the order of magnitude of the increased consumptive water use involved and analyses the implications as seen from two parallel perspectives; the global perspective of human development within a "safe operating space" with regard to the definition of the Planetary Boundary for freshwater; and the social-ecological implications at the regional river basin scale in terms of sharpening water shortages and threats to aquatic ecosystems. The paper shows that the consumptive water use involved in the dual task would both transgress the proposed planetary boundary range for global consumptive freshwater use and would further exacerbate already severe river depletion, causing societal problems related to water shortage and water allocation. Thus, strategies to rely on sequestration of CO2 as a mitigation strategy must recognize the high freshwater costs involved, implying that the key climate mitigation strategy must be to reduce emissions. The paper finally highlights the need to analyze both water and carbon tradeoffs from anticipated large scale biofuel production climate change mitigation strategy, to reveal gains and impact of this in contrast to carbon sequestration strategies.									27	0	0	1	0	27	5	27	0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000208934000002		J	Zhao Xingang; Liu Lu; Liu Xiaomeng; Wang Jieyu; Liu Pingkuo				Xin-Gang, Zhao/J-3413-2012				A critical-analysis on the development of China hydropower								RENEWABLE ENERGY				44				1	6		10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.005				AUG 2012	2012	With the increasing scarcity of fossil fuel resources, the demand for greenhouse gas reduction and environmental protection all over the world, developing hydropower becomes one of the most important energy strategies.

A new "zero-emissions stabilization (Z-stabilization)" is proposed, where CO2 emissions are reduced to zero at some time and thereafter the concentration is decreased by natural removal processes, eventually reaching an equilibrated stable state. Simplified climate experiments show that, under Z-stabilization, considerably larger emissions are permissible in the near future compared with traditional stabilization, with the same constraint on temperature rise. Over longer time scales, the concentration and temperature decrease close to their equilibrium values, much lower than those under traditional stabilization. The smaller temperature rise at final state is essential to avoid longer-term risk of sea level rise, a significant concern under traditional stabilization. Because of these advantages a Z-stabilization pathway can be a candidate of practical mitigation strategies as treated in Part 2.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	6	0386-2208			WOS:000307434300005	22850727	J	Webb, Janette					Webb, Janette/0000-0001-8295-346X			Society and a low-carbon future: individual behaviour change or new social values and priorities?								EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH				103	2	SI		157	163		10.1017/S1755691013000054				JUL 2012	2012	Although Scottish and UK governments have ambitious targets for climate change mitigation, and there is increased understanding of the risks to future prosperity of fossil fuel energy dependence, limited practical progress has been made by the advanced economies in reducing carbon emissions, especially when embedded emissions in imported consumer goods are taken into account. Significant contributory factors are the social and cultural values, beliefs and practices, which result in risks of climate change being regarded as secondary to short-term pressures for economic growth and increased consumer spending. The result is that climate change and transition to a low-carbon society become 'back of the mind' issues. Current policy designed to lower carbon emissions from household consumption treats society as a series of individuals, each responding rationally to market incentives to maximise short-term personal gain. 'Greener choices' are incentivised and encouraged by social marketing, but, at best, this approach will achieve only very gradual change. An alternative model treats society as comprising historically evolving, dynamic social systems and cultures that are capable of dealing with transformational change, when there is a shared understanding of the reasons for acting. From this perspective, society can implement step changes in behaviour through collaborative action in the interests of the longer-term common good. Political momentum can be gathered for new legislative and/or taxation measures, as for example in the case of the strong programme for tobacco control legislation in Scotland and the UK. By focusing on social and technical infrastructures, the built environment, and the regeneration of local economies, rather than on individual behaviours, government investment can have far greater impact. A distinctively Scottish narrative for a low-carbon society can create momentum for transition through shared understanding of the risks of climate change, and its meanings for social life, cultures, economic relationships and values.									3	0	0	1	0	3	0	56	1755-6910	1755-6929		WOS:000325719700005		J	Campbell, Colin D.; Lilly, Allan; Towers, Willie; Chapman, Stephen J.; Werritty, Alan; Hanley, Nick				Campbell, Colin D/B-3944-2010	Campbell, Colin D/0000-0002-5163-7656			Land use and a low-carbon society								EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH				103	2	SI		165	173		10.1017/S1755691013000066				JUL 2012	2012	Land use and the management of our natural resources such as soils and water offer great opportunities to sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change. Actions on forestry, soil carbon and damaged peatlands each have the potential to reduce Scottish emissions in 2020 by hundreds of thousands of tonnes. Most actions to reduce emissions from land use have beneficial effects on other ecosystem services, so if we can cut emissions we can in many circumstances improve the environment. The cost of reducing emissions through land use change can be low in relation to other means of cutting emissions. The Scottish Land Use Strategy and the Ecosystem Approach it calls for, employing the concept of ecosystem services, offers a way of balancing environmental, social and economic demands on the land. Scotland's land, soils, forests and waters are all likely to be significantly altered by future climate change. Each of these components of the land-based environment offers opportunities for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The emerging new imperatives for securing food, water and energy at a global level are equally important for Scotland, and interact with the need for environmental security and for dealing with climate change.									10	0	0	8	0	10	0	22	1755-6910	1755-6929		WOS:000325719700006		J	Yoo, Gayoung; Kang, Hojeong				Kang, Hojeong/C-7208-2011				Effects of Biochar Addition on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Microbial Responses in a Short-Term Laboratory Experiment								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY				41	4			1193	1202		10.2134/jeq2011.0157				JUL 2012	2012	Biochar application to soil has drawn much attention as a strategy to sequester atmospheric carbon in soil ecosystems. The applicability of this strategy as a climate change mitigation option is limited by our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in greenhouse gas emissions from soils, microbial responses, and soil fertility changes. We conducted an 8-wk laboratory incubation using soils from PASTURE (silt loam) and RICE PADDY (silt loam) sites with and without two types of biochar (biochar from swine manure [CHAR-M] and from barley stover [CHAR-B]). Responses to addition of the different biochars varied with the soil source. Addition of CHAR-B did not change CO2 and CH4 evolution from the PASTURE or the RICE PADDY soils, but there was a decrease in N2O emissions from the PASTURE soil. The effects of CHAR-M addition on greenhouse gas emissions were different for the soils. The most substantial change was an increase in N2O emissions from the RICE PADDY soil. This result was attributed to a combination of abundant denitrifiers in this soil and increased net nitrogen mineralization. Soil phosphatase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the CHAR-B-treated soils was enhanced compared with the controls for both soils. Fungal biomass was higher in the CHAR-B-treated RICE PADDY soil. From our results, we suggest CHAR-B to be an appropriate amendment for the PASTURE and RICE PADDY soils because it provides increased nitrogen availability and microbial activity with no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Application of CHAR-M to RICE PADDY soils could result in excess nitrogen availability, which may increase N2O emissions and possible NO 3 leaching problems. Thus, this study confirms that the ability of environmentally sound biochar additions to sequester carbon in soils depends on the characteristics of the receiving soil as well as the nature of the biochar.									61	8	0	56	0	69	3	171	0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000305966900024	22751062	J	Hein, Lars; Leemans, Rik				Leemans, Rik/A-1548-2009	Leemans, Rik/0000-0002-4001-6301			The Impact of First-Generation Biofuels on the Depletion of the Global Phosphorus Reserve								AMBIO				41	4			341	349		10.1007/s13280-012-0253-x				JUN 2012	2012	The large majority of biofuels to date is "first-generation" biofuel made from agricultural commodities. All first-generation biofuel production systems require phosphorus (P) fertilization. P is an essential plant nutrient, yet global reserves are finite. We argue that committing scarce P to biofuel production involves a trade-off between climate change mitigation and future food production. We examine biofuel production from seven types of feedstock, and find that biofuels at present consume around 2% of the global inorganic P fertilizer production. For all examined biofuels, with the possible exception of sugarcane, the contribution to P depletion exceeds the contribution to mitigating climate change. The relative benefits of biofuels can be increased through enhanced recycling of P, but high increases in P efficiency are required to balance climate change mitigation and P depletion impacts. We conclude that, with the current production systems, the production of first-generation biofuels compromises food production in the future.									30	0	0	9	0	30	0	40	0044-7447	1654-7209		WOS:000304617700003	22351599	J	Antonio Suarez, Jose; Anibal Beaton, Pedro; Faxas Escalona, Ronoldy; Perez Montero, Ofelia								Energy, environment and development in Cuba								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				16	5			2724	2731		10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.023				JUN 2012	2012	In Cuba, since 1959, the energy, environment and socio-economic development have been given high priority in national development plans. Fifty years later, the Cuban people have achieved a society with notable advances in literacy and education, health, culture, sports, social security and per capita of the gross domestic product (GDP), which has permitted the attainment of a sustainable development, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report in 2006.The energy sector has been evolving constantly in the last 50 years, achieving as the main result the distribution of electricity to 97% of the country, the growth of domestic oil production to achieve about 47% of the total consumption, the introduction of the distributed generation of electricity reaching 40% on the generation, rehabilitation of the electric appliances, systematization of the Cuban Electricity Conservation Program (PAEC), the Energy Conservation Program of the Ministry of Education (PAEME) and rapid introduction of renewable energy technologies, with good results in demand side management, energy efficiency and energy education.Actually, soil degradation, deforestation, pollution, loss of biological diversity and lack of water have been identified as the main environmental problems; several plans and projects have been applied, in order to reduce their impact, following the policy expressed in the National Environmental Strategy.However, challenges exist for future development in Cuba in coming years, from an economical point of view will be necessary the enhancement of the economic relations with the American and European countries, to solve internal problems such as insufficient productivity, correspondence between the level of activities with the financial, material and human resources, to promote growth in the levels of exports and to achieve the substitution of imported basic food; the energy sector need to achieve growth in the levels of prospection and exploitation of domestic oil, to diversify fossil energy and energetic technologies suppliers, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy; the protection of the environment will demand to develop research about adaptation and mitigation of climate change, conservation and rational use of natural resources, in particular, the lands, water and forests.

In contrast, we explored through qualitative interviews (n?=?202) across five European countries how members of the public conceptualized climate change within a wider context of energy and the future, drawing on social representation theory. Our analysis suggests that, rather than separating between environmental issues, participants interpreted both climate change and energy consumption in a context of unsustainable resource use. Views on climate change were often very sceptical, but the unsustainability of contemporary resource use was almost unanimously of great concern. However, despite their strong plea for political change towards sustainability, many interviewees found it challenging to translate their views into behaviour. We argue that obstacles for behavioural change might lie in the tensions between cognitive, normative and affective aspects of people's representations, and conclude with recommendations for European climate change mitigation policies.

In this paper we sketch neglected links between these now major research areas and discuss how subjective well-being and employment could be raised in the medium term by cost-effective mitigation and green fiscal policy, in addition to the long-run benefits of greenhouse gas reductions. A green new deal placing more emphasis on climate change mitigation and happiness (rather than GDP as the key proxy for welfare) could be the appropriate strategy in the current economic climate of austerity and worsening recession, while also initiating the large-scale mitigation investment for job creation that is so urgently needed.

We construct a static computable general equilibrium model for Taiwan to fulfill our purpose. The model is benchmarked in 2006 and includes detailed specification of power generation technology and renewable energy producing sectors. It also distinguishes sources of imported energy to reflect Taiwan's current policy of diversifying sources of supply for energy. Simulations using the model have been focused on both changes in energy price and quantity of energy supply under specific specifications of the development of renewable energy technologies and CO2 emission reduction requirements. Our simulation results demonstrate that energy security and climate change mitigation interact each other, and under a specific emission reduction target, the effect of exogenous energy shocks on the economy will be partially absorbed by the internal adjustment mechanism of the economy.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0921-030X	1573-0840		WOS:000302408500002		J	Cheung, William W.

Oceanatmospheric changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets. Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly those measures that clearly have other co-benefits.

While work on some diseases, such as phoma stem canker of oilseed rape and fusarium ear blight of wheat, that combine crop growth, disease development and climate change models is described in detail, climate-change projections and predictions of the resulting biotic responses to them are complex to predict and detailed models linking climate, crop growth and disease development are not available for many crop-pathogen systems. This review uses a novel approach of comparing pathogen biology according to 'ecotype' (a categorization based on aspects such as epidemic type, dissemination method and infection biology), guided by detailed disease progress models where available to identify potential future research priorities for disease control. Consequences of projected climate change are assessed for factors driving elements of disease cycles of fungal pathogens (nine important pathogens are assessed in detail), viruses, bacteria and phytoplasmas. Other diseases classified according to 'ecotypes' were reviewed and likely changes in their severity used to guide comparable diseases about which less information is available. Both direct and indirect effects of climate change are discussed, with an emphasis on examples from the UK, and considered in the context of other factors that influence diseases and particularly emergence of new diseases, such as changes to farm practices and introductions of exotic material and effects of other environment changes such as elevated CO2. Good crop disease control will contribute to climate change mitigation by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while sustaining production. Strategies for adaptation to climate change are needed to maintain disease control and crop yields in north-west Europe.					9th Conference of the European-Foundation-for-Plant-Pathology9th Conference of the European-Foundation-for-Plant-Pathology	NOV 15-18, 2010NOV 15-18, 2010	European Fdn Plant PatholEuropean Fdn Plant Pathol	Univ Evora, Evora, PORTUGALUniv Evora, Evora, PORTUGAL	49	1	0	42	0	51	4	160	0929-1873	1573-8469		WOS:000302232600022		J	Krohn, Brian J.; Fripp, Matthias								A life cycle assessment of biodiesel derived from the "niche filling" energy crop camelina in the USA								APPLIED ENERGY				92				92	98		10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.10.025				APR 2012	2012	Camelina sativa (L) is a promising crop for biodiesel production that avoids many of the potential pitfalls of traditional biofuel crops, such as land use change (LUC) and food versus fuel. In this study the environmental viability of camelina biodiesel was assessed using life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology. The LCA was conducted using the spreadsheet model dubbed KABAM. KABAM found that camelina grown as a niche filling crop (in rotation with wheat or as a double crop) reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil fuel use by 40-60% when compared to petroleum diesel. Furthermore, by avoiding LUC emissions, camelina biodiesel emits fewer GHGs than traditional soybean and canola biodiesel. Finally, a sensitivity analysis concluded that in order to maintain and increase the environmental viability of camelina and other niche filling biofuel crops, researchers and policy makers should focus their efforts on achieving satisfactory yields (1000-2000 kg/ha) while reducing nitrogen fertilizer inputs.

This paper addresses the multi-level governance problem of coherently addressing key interactions between four Earth sub-systems - climate change, freshwater use, land use and biodiversity - taking into account concerns over problem shifting. After discussing possibilities for regional downscaling of the boundaries, we explore challenges for the EU region to coherently address this particular set of interacting Earth sub-systems and reduce the risk of problem shifting. This analysis demonstrates that Earth system interactions can be governed, but that they likely require comprehensive packages of governance responses across both sub-systems and levels. Three overarching governance functions are tentatively identified that directly or indirectly address Earth system interactions: reduction of system stress, risks and vulnerabilities; triggering and navigation of transformation of economic activity; and development of a diversity of options. Finally, the paper briefly discusses political and institutional challenges for developing, enabling and stabilising these governance functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The need to accurately simulate the hygrothermal environment inside the archive building which houses mainly paper-based records led to the choice of EnergyPlus as the modelling software. The study presents the simulation results of five environmental strategies which predict energy saving potential as high as 43% without significantly affecting the quality of the preservation environment. The effect of climate change is predicted to have little impact on the archive environment due to the filtering effect of the air conditioning system. On the other hand, an increase in total energy load by 15% and 24% is predicted under the worst case climate change scenario in 2050 and 2080, respectively, if the current environmental management practice is continued into the future. However, the identified energy saving strategies could represent possible mitigative solutions in reducing future energy load against the impact of climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Such teams must involve (at least) Building Physicists, Engineers, Economists, Epidemiologists. Statisticians, Behavioural Scientists, Complexity Scientists and Policy Makers.

Companies and organizations currently participating in the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) were surveyed regarding their perception of consumers' concerns with climate change, attitudes toward government regulations, factors important to their emission management decisions, and their interest in buying and paying premiums for carbon credits sourced from urban forestry. Statistical analysis of the responses reveals noticeable differences among various types of business organizations. The findings are useful for understanding how businesses respond to different kinds of green products and will help in the development of green product markets. Finally, the results will help in developing effective environmental policies that respond well to businesses' objectives and preferences.

In this paper we review the possibilities for win-win climate and development outcomes in programs that distribute improved cookstoves with the use of carbon finance. We show that improved cookstove technologies form an important, if asymmetrical, environment-development interface, and illustrate the mutually supported local (development) and global (climate change) benefits of continued improved stoves use-where success in one program area is directly tied to benefits in the other. We also describe how program results are highly contextual and that, in practice, there are a number of challenges to achieving effective 'win-win' outcomes-including cultural, financial, governance and technological barriers. While carbon finance provides an opportunity to fund scaleable and enforceable stove programs, it may also introduce mutually supported impediments-where progress towards one set of program objectives, directly compromises progress towards other objectives. Drawing on development debates for improved cookstove use, scientific reports on stove-based greenhouse gas reductions, and preexisting case studies of carbon and non-carbon financed cookstoves in Peru. Uganda and Cambodia, we conclude that the challenge for future carbon financed improved cookstove projects will be to leverage inherent symbioses between climate and development arenas in order to overcome mutually supported impediments. Achieving substantive win-win conditions will require further scholarly and practical engagement to tackle the many outstanding challenges and uncertainties reviewed in this essay.

In order to be effective in climate change mitigation, the storage of CO2 will be required for many hundreds of years until well past the end of the fossil fuel era (www.sepa.org.uk/climate_change/solutions/carbon_capture_and_storage.aspx). It is through avoiding the release of CO2 into the atmosphere that CCS is considered to offer an opportunity to help mitigate the effects of climate change. Scotland has the potential to be the location of one of the world's first full chain CCS Projects and, although all parts of the CCS chain have been demonstrated, and the chain itself demonstrated at small scale, as confirmed by the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI) in its 2011 report The Global status of CCS' there are still no examples of a full chain commercially sized CCS Project in operation anywhere in the world. There are a series of risks embedded in the development and implementation of CCS and it is the focus of Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as the environmental regulator in Scotland alongside other regulators, to assess and manage these risks to an acceptable mitigation state and then operationalise the regulatory requirements. This article provides an overview of the issues and the process for risk management. In order to consider the effectiveness of the regulatory framework and to expose and address any potential risks ahead of any live CCS Projects, SEPA worked with the Scottish Government to develop an innovative project designed to test Scotland's regulatory framework through a novel assessment methodology based on emergency planning scenarios. The principal objectives were to identify regulatory gaps or overlaps and elements that could be streamlined or better managed, and to evaluate the risks, barriers, information gaps and any other issues that would affect the successful demonstration and deployment of CCS in Scotland.

Projects aimed at cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will need to be evaluated against dual criteria: from the viewpoint of the developed countries they must cut emissions of GHGs at reasonable cost, while host countries will assess their contribution to development, or simply their overall economic benefits. Co-benefits of some types of project will also be of interest to host countries: for example some projects will contribute to reducing air pollution, thus improving the health of the local population.This paper uses a simple damage function methodology to quantify some of the health co-benefits of replacing coal-fired generation with wind or small hydro in China. We estimate the monetary value of these co-benefits and find that it is probably small compared to the added costs. We have not made a full cost-benefit analysis of renewable energy in China as some likely co-benefits are omitted from our calculations. Our results are subject to considerable uncertainty however, after careful consideration of their likely accuracy and comparisons with other studies, we believe that they provide a good first cut estimate of co-benefits and are sufficiently robust to stand as a guide for policy makers.In addition to these empirical results, a key contribution made by the paper is to demonstrate a simple and reasonably accurate methodology for health benefits estimation that applies the most recent academic research in the field to the solution of an increasingly important problem.

The effects of climate change on human health are diverse in nature and range from direct effects due to extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and storms, to indirect effects such as those caused by water and food shortages. Methods: A telephone survey was conducted between January and February 2009, on a stratified representative random sample of the Maltese population over the age of 18 years (N = 310 819). Results: Five hundred and forty-three individuals successfully participated in the survey giving a response rate of 92.7%. The respondent sample was very similar to the target population by gender ( P = 0.977), age (P = 0.767) and district (P = 0.812). The results of the study demonstrate a very strong relationship between the perception of climate change as a threat to health and well-being, support for climate change mitigation policy and a willingness to implement measures to address climate change. Conclusion: The findings of this study show that the perception that climate change may claim lives, cause disease, reduce the standard of living and worsen water shortages, may be the strongest driver behind support for climate change mitigation policy and a willingness to act. It is recommended that, in order to gain more public support, climate change campaigns and risk communication strategies should frame climate change as a threat to human health and general well-being.									11	1	0	2	1	13	1	31	1101-1262			WOS:000299746500033	21126980	J	Anable, Jillian; Brand, Christian; Martino Tran; Eyre, Nick					Brand, Christian/0000-0002-1535-5328			Modelling transport energy demand: A socio-technical approach								ENERGY POLICY				41				125	138		10.1016/j.enpol.2010.08.020				FEB 2012	2012	Despite an emerging consensus that societal energy consumption and related emissions are not only influenced by technical efficiency but also by lifestyles and socio-cultural factors, few attempts have been made to operationalise these insights in models of energy demand. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The 'what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security.

We considered similar to 400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming similar to 0.5 degrees C by 2050. This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs ( less than $250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide-reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2 degrees C threshold.									580	13	3	193	0	594	32	500	0036-8075			WOS:000299033100044	22246768	B	Ozalp, Nesrin			ASME	Ozalp, Nesrin/C-4146-2016	Ozalp, Nesrin/0000-0003-2922-4473			ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT, AND ECONOMICAL ADVANTAGES OF SOLAR THERMAL CRACKING OF NATURAL GAS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 31ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2012, VOL 6								851	857						2012	2012	Among all fossil fuels, natural gas is probably the most attractive one because of its higher heating value, and approximately 97% methane content, which creates less hazardous emissions during power generation. Considering these important facts and the demand for natural gas in the world market, it would be unlikely to think of converting natural gas. However, if we want to utilize our planet's limited natural gas resources better, then we need to explore alternative ways. A way to achieve that goal is direct cracking of natural gas via solar thermal processing. This paper describes advantages of solar cracking of natural gas from energy, environment and economic point of view. Results show that products of natural gas decomposition contain 8% more energy per mole compared to natural gas itself, while the decomposition process does not emit any hazardous emissions to the environment. As for the economics, once the decomposition products of natural gas, namely hydrogen and carbon black, are sold separately, it is possible to make up to three times more revenue than the selling of natural gas. The products of natural gas decomposition have a very wide use in chemical and petroleum industries. For example, hydrogen is a crucial commodity to refine crude oil, while carbon black is the fundamental component in car tire, battery, conveyer belt, and printer ink manufacturing industries. Currently, petroleum industry produces hydrogen via steam reforming of methane and the chemical industry produces carbon black from coal or natural gas combustion in furnace, which are both highly toxic and global warming emissive processes. With solar cracking of natural gas, these two important commodities can be produced without any emissions to the environment.					31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering31st ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering	JUL 01-06, 2012JUL 01-06, 2012	Petrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivPetrobras; ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	7			978-0-7918-4493-9	WOS:000324655500099		B	Joubert, Fanny; Begovic, Milena			IEEE					Improved cookstove carbon offset project in Kenya How a single technology can benefit both the environment and the local populations								WORLD CONGRESS ON SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES (WCST-2012)								65	70						2012	2012	The dependence on inefficient cookstoves using firewood in Kenya has far-reaching consequences on the environment, health and economic development. The CDM Program of Activities presented in this paper, aims to manufacture and distribute on the long term 100,000 improved cook stoves (called Konsava stove) to rural households in Kenya, in order to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Results of performance tests of the Konsava stove show a thermal efficiency of 24.3% and a specific fuel consumption of 147g/l. Fuel wood savings are assessed at 58.8% compared to the traditional open three stones cooking stove widely used in rural Kenya. Thus, the implementation of this new sustainable technology is expected to significantly contribute not only to the improvement of environmental conditions (climate change mitigation, reduced deforestation), but also to rural populations livelihoods (improvement of indoor air quality, savings of money and/or time collecting firewood).

Though, most of the climatic warming that has occurred has been caused by human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels that generate the greenhouse gas emissions. However, in urban area, the transport sector is one of the most important causes of the high levels of atmospheric pollution: greenhouse gas and fine particulate matter emitted by the gasoline and diesel engines. The introduction of alternative fuel in the transport sector which is less pollutant, economically more affordable and more available is an alternative quite interesting to reduce air pollution while allowing economic and social development of Algeria. Using Compressed Natural Gas 'CNG' for vehicle is an alternative which is environmentally friendly as well as economically and energetically interesting, it is also in accordance with the world energy tendency which sustains the future use of gaseous fuels that are subscribed in the decarbonization process of the energetic systems (reducing the fuels carbon content).In this item, an overview of the Algerian automobile fleet will be exposed. And the economic, energetic and environmental matters of the introduction of the CNG as fuel in the Algerian transport sector will be discussed. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Eco certificates confirm that by using, or combusting wood fuels no gas emissions occur that might have harmful effect on environment. Apart from fuels, the analysis included eco certification of wood fuels burning appliances as well, since their characterictics also impact combustion quality and composition of gas emissions generated in that process. By applying this type of certificates, consumers are enabled to have direct impact on environment protection and climate change mitigation by selecting eco products.					5th International Conference on Wood and Furniture Industry in Times of Change - New trends and challenges (WoodEMA)5th International Conference on Wood and Furniture Industry in Times of Change - New trends and challenges (WoodEMA)	JUN 06-08, 2012JUN 06-08, 2012	Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius; Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Rector; Fac Mass Media Commun, DeanUniv Ss Cyril & Methodius; Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Rector; Fac Mass Media Commun, Dean	Trnava, SLOVAKIATrnava, SLOVAKIA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0			978-80-8105-374-0	WOS:000313551800011		S	Chen, Yi-Cheng; Ko, Yu-Lun; Peng, Wen-Chih						Kuo, YH; Tseng, VSM; Kao, HY; Hong, TP; Horng, MF		An Intelligent System for Mining Usage Patterns from Appliance Data in Smart Home Environment								2012 CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (TAAI)		Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence						319	322		10.1109/TAAI.2012.54				2012	2012	In the last decade, considerable concern has arisen over the electricity saving due to the issue of reducing greenhouse gases. Previous studies on usage pattern utilization mainly are focused on power disaggregation and appliance recognition. Little attention has been paid to utilizing pattern mining for the target of energy saving. In this paper, we develop an intelligent system which analyzes appliance usage to extract users' behavior patterns in a smart home environment. With the proposed system, users can acquire the electricity consumption of each appliance for energy saving easily. In advance, if the electricity cost is high, users can observe the abnormal usage of appliances from the proposed system. Furthermore, we also apply our system on real-world dataset to show the practicability of mining usage pattern in smart home environment.					17th Annual Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)17th Annual Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI)	NOV 16-18, 2012NOV 16-18, 2012	Taiwanese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn; NCKU, Comp & Network Ctr; Natl Sci Council; Minist Educ; IEEE, Tainan Sect; IEEE Comp Soc, Tainan Chapter; IEEE Signal Process Soc, Tainan Chapter; Inst Informat Ind; Inst Informat Sci, Acad Sinica; Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat; Natl Univ Kaohsiung; Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci; Natl Chung Cheng Univ; Natl Dong Hwa UnivTaiwanese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn; NCKU, Comp & Network Ctr; Natl Sci Council; Minist Educ; IEEE, Tainan Sect; IEEE Comp Soc, Tainan Chapter; IEEE Signal Process Soc, Tainan Chapter; Inst Informat Ind; Inst Informat Sci, Acad Sinica; Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat; Natl Univ Kaohsiung; Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci; Natl Chung Cheng Univ; Natl Dong Hwa Univ	Taiwanese Assoc Artificial Intelligence (TAAI), Tainan, TAIWANTaiwanese Assoc Artificial Intelligence (TAAI), Tainan, TAIWAN	5	1	0	0	0	5	0	8	2376-6816		978-0-7695-4919-4; 978-1-4673-4976-5	WOS:000313560200052		S	Vergara, Sintana E.; Tchobanoglous, George						Gadgil, A; Liverman, DM		Municipal Solid Waste and the Environment: A Global Perspective								ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 37		Annual Review of Environment and Resources		37				277	310		10.1146/annurev-environ-050511-122532				2012	2012	Municipal solid waste (MSW) reflects the culture that produces it and affects the health of the people and the environment surrounding it. Globally, people are discarding growing quantities of waste, and its composition is more complex than ever before, as plastic and electronic consumer products diffuse. Concurrently, the world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. These trends pose a challenge to cities, which are charged with managing waste in a socially and environmentally acceptable manner. Effective waste management strategies depend on local waste characteristics, which vary with cultural, climatic, and socioeconomic variables, and institutional capacity. Globally, waste governance is becoming regionalized and formalized. In industrialized nations, where citizens produce far more waste than do other citizens, waste tends to be managed formally at a municipal or regional scale. In less-industrialized nations, where citizens produce less waste, which is mostly biogenic, a combination of formal and informal actors manages waste. Many waste management policies, technologies, and behaviors provide a variety of environmental benefits, including climate change mitigation. Key waste management challenges include integrating the informal waste sector in developing cities, reducing consumption in industrialized cities, increasing and standardizing the collection and analysis of solid waste data, and effectively managing increasingly complex waste while protecting people and the environment.									85	2	0	33	3	87	9	196	1543-5938		978-0-8243-2337-0	WOS:000310224900013		J	Colombier, Michel; Li, Jun								Shaping climate policy in the housing sector in northern Chinese cities								CLIMATE POLICY				12	4			453	473		10.1080/14693062.2011.592665				2012	2012	What are relevant urban development investment strategies for improving building energy efficiency (BEE) and decarbonizing the urban district heating supply in rapidly urbanizing China? Different trajectories of BEE and energy supply technologies are compared in the urban context in a northern Chinese city. Vigorous improvement of BEE will significantly enhance the prospective financial capacity to facilitate deployment of backstop technologies (e.g. carbon capture and storage) in order to decarbonize the energy supply and achieve the long-term targets of low-carbon buildings. Carbon finance instruments should be used to facilitate public policy to accompany the necessary transition in the urban development process. The government-run efficiency procurement scheme will overcome the problem of insufficient incentive and high transaction costs associated with individual Clean Development Mechanism projects. Appropriate investment strategies (allocation of financial resources over the time frame) will allow local governments to harness the large potentials of carbon emissions mitigation while minimizing the risk of long-term technical lock-in in the built environment in Chinese cities.									5	0	0	0	0	5	2	31	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000304461600005		J	Fay, John; Kapfudzaruwa, Farai; Na, Lin; Matheson, Shirley								A comparative policy analysis of the Clean Development Mechanism in South Africa and China								CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT				4	1			40	53		10.1080/17565529.2011.628182				2012	2012	There has been a general expectation that the emerging economies of South Africa and China, which are heavily dependent upon fossil fuels, could successfully leverage the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). However, experience to date indicates that South Africa has significantly lagged behind China in the uptake of CDM, accounting for only 0.9 per cent of the worldwide registered annual Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), whereas China has dominated the market, generating 54 per cent of the annual worldwide CERs. This article provides a comparative analysis of the CDM experience in China and South Africa to identify the underlying drivers and obstacles to CDM in both countries. The analysis reveals that a strong industrial and energy policy in the host country plays a crucial role in the development of CDM. Our analysis indicates that policies which foster a low-carbon pathway encourage CDM uptake, rather than CDM driving a low-emission development pathway. In addition, the active engagement by key government and private sector stakeholders and the presence of a friendly business environment to uptake CDM significantly impact the utilization of the mechanism.									4	0	0	0	0	4	1	9	1756-5529			WOS:000303567100005		S	Liu, Yan; Han, Ying; Zhang, Baozhong; Zhou, Xuejie; Zhang, Guoqiang; Zhao, Xiang						Zhang, H; Jin, D		Development of Electric Automobiles and Electric Vehicle Charging Facilities in China								ADVANCED RESEARCH ON ENGINEERING MATERIALS, ENERGY, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL, PTS 1 AND 2		Advanced Materials Research		424-425				945	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.424-425.945				2012	2012	The problem of energy saving and environment protection has become more and more crucial in China.

This survey examined how well local planning directors have been prepared for climate change, including awareness, analysis scope, and implementation strategy.Findings - The descriptive results indicate that the directors who responded to this survey had a relatively high (79.87 percent) level of awareness for climate change; but they had limited (34.94 percent) analysis scopes to assess the sources, impacts, and risk of climate change in their jurisdictions. These directors had partially but not fully (51.51 percent) developed local land use planning implementation strategies to mitigate or adapt climate change. The regression model indicates that the political commitment and planning personnel resources have significant influence on local planning directors' actions for climate change.Originality/value - This paper provides policy implications to improve local land use planning ability for climate change mitigation and adaptation.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	11	1756-8692			WOS:000302111700006		J	Poudel, Bishnu Chandra; Sathre, Roger; Bergh, Johan; Gustavsson, Leif; Lundstrom, Anders; Hyvonen, Riitta				Bergh, Johan/R-4501-2016	Bergh, Johan/0000-0003-4723-1626			Potential effects of intensive forestry on biomass production and total carbon balance in north-central Sweden								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY				15	1			106	124		10.1016/j.envsci.2011.09.005				JAN 2012	2012	We quantify the potential effects of intensive forest management activities on forest production in north-central Sweden over the next 100 years, and calculate the potential climate change mitigation feedback effect due to the resulting increased carbon stock and increased use of forest products. We analyze and compare four different forest management scenarios (Reference, Environment, Production, and Maximum), all of which include the expected effects of climate change based on SRES B2 scenario. Forest management practices are intensified in Production scenario, and further intensified in Maximum scenario. Four different models, BIOMASS, HUGIN, Q-model, and Substitution model, were used to quantify net primary production, forest production and harvest potential, soil carbon, and biomass substitution of fossil fuels and non-wood materials, respectively. After integrating the models, our results show that intensive forestry may increase forest production by up to 26% and annual harvest by up to 19%, compared to the Reference scenario. The greatest single effect on the carbon balance is from using increased biomass production to substitute for fossil fuels and energy intensive materials. Carbon stocks in living tree biomass, forest soil and wood products also increase. In total, a net carbon emission reduction of up to 132 Tg (for Maximum scenario) is possible during the next 100 years due to intensive forest management in two Swedish counties, Jamtland and Vasternorrland.

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				21	1			60	70		10.1002/bse.722				JAN 2012	2012	Products with a superior environmental performance, such as a high level of energy efficiency, are typically subject to information asymmetries. Therefore these product attributes are often undervalued in purchase decisions. Signaling, e.g. energy labeling, can overcome these asymmetries, with positive implications for effective consumer decisions, competitive advantage for suppliers of energy-efficient goods, and for societal goals such as mitigating climate change. However, there is a scarcity of research investigating how energy labels actually influence consumer choice. The recent revision of the European Union energy label provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of energy labeling in a quasi field-experimental setting. We show that the proposed extension of the seven-point A-G rating scale by adding new classes A+, A++, etc. will result in a lower perceived importance of energy efficiency in consumer decision-making. Based on a stated preference survey investigating 2244 choices by German consumers, we conclude that the revision actually undermines the label's ability to overcome information asymmetries, hence potentially contributing to market failure.

The improved performance of new buildings has been offset by the increased size of the stock and other rebound effects. Significant gaps exist in the data and understanding of building stocks' composition and dynamics as well as of the actual energy impacts of refurbishment. Most methods to address existing buildings and stocks are inappropriate as they are conceptually derived from new construction. The discussion about the relation between demand reduction and decarbonization of the energy supply needs to be extended specifically to consider existing buildings. New types of target systems based on the continuous control of effective performance are considered. An alternative scenario is proposed: long-term incremental changes and the formulation of technological options. This is based on continuous monitoring and systematic risk evaluation. The conservation of the physical, economic, social and cultural value of the building stock can only be reached through a comprehensive incremental transformation of the stock. A research agenda is explored to support this strategy.									13	0	0	0	0	13	0	13	0961-3218	1466-4321		WOS:000306220700002		J	Skea, Jim								Research and evidence needs for decarbonisation in the built environment: a UK case study								BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION				40	4	SI		432	445		10.1080/09613218.2012.670395				2012	2012	The research and evaluation needs to support radical decarbonisation in the built environment are examined for the UK. Since buildings account for approximately 40% of UK energy demand, energy use in buildings will need to be transformed if ambitious climate policy objectives are to be met. In the context of wider energy system change, the needs are for greater efficiency, greater use of electric technologies such as heat pumps as electricity become cleaner, and the use of renewable heat such as biomass. At the same time, the introduction of smart technology offers new opportunities to measure and evaluate changes in demand patterns and the impact of policy interventions. The paper notes that the technical and social dimensions of radical decarbonisation are intimately intertwined. Therefore, social and economic research has a vital role to play in supporting the design and implementation of effective policy, taking advantage of new data-collection opportunities. Drawing on lessons from other policy domains, the paper explores the role that rigorous policy evaluation techniques, little used in the energy domain, could play. It identifies a range of concerns, relating to the political sphere, policy delivery and consumer acceptance, that would need to be addressed.									17	0	0	0	0	17	0	8	0961-3218	1466-4321		WOS:000306220700004		J	Cruz Ramos, Ariel; Flores Delgado, Alfredo; Ibarra-Yunez, Alejandro; Zamorano Cervantes, Homar					Ibarra-Yunez, Alejandro/0000-0003-1568-3273			Territorial Distribution Analysis of Projects of the Clean Development Mechanism: The Case of the Mexican States								ECONOMIA MEXICANA-NUEVA EPOCA				21	2			213	250						2012	2012	This investigation classifies Mexican states according to their strength for attracting clean development mechanism (CDM) projects, as a means to promote economic development from donating Annex I countries of the Kyoto Protocol. We calculated that 46.5 per cent of all CDM projects are concentrated in the states of Jalisco, Coahuila, Puebla, Durango and Veracruz. The study classifies the 32 Mexican states using cluster analysis, based on three dimensions: potential to achieve gas reductions, institutional capacities to tackle the environment; and the general investment climate. The technique creates five clusters where the key variable responds to greenhouse gas reduction projects. Findings have implications both for CDM policies, their federal and state coordination, and also for investment readiness by some states that demonstrate institutional capabilities, but where State-owned Pemex and CFE have shown low attraction of projects and shallow institutional commitment. The paper contributes to analyze the distribution of this type of projects at sub-national level, and their pulling and limiting forces.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	8	1665-2045			WOS:000208870200001		J	Newbery, David M.

Over the last century the changing assumptions about human-nature relationship have led to numerous meanings of "the environment" in planning. These have in turn influenced the choices made between: preserving, enhancing, protecting, compromising, trading, exploiting or guarding against, the environment. While recognizing the nuances of the environmental discourses, this paper identifies eight distinct meanings of the environment in contemporary plans including the environment: as local amenity, as heritage landscape, as nature reserve, as storehouse of resources, as tradable commodity, as problem, as sustainability and as risk. The latter has emerged as a result of growing climate change awareness. The paper argues that, while the emphasis on climate change mitigation has reinforced some aspects of the sustainability discourse, the adaptation agenda has introduced a new meaning of the environment as risk. This portrays the environment not so much in terms of assets to be sustained for human benefit, but in terms of threats against which human well-being should be safeguarded. Framed in the language of risk and security, this new discourse is bringing to the fore some of the outmoded approaches to planning.									27	0	0	2	0	27	2	24	0965-4313	1469-5944		WOS:000301781000004		B	Hossain, Md Mohataz; Ahmed, Khandaker Shabbir						Klumpp, M		TOWARDS PERFORMANCE BASED DESIGN: SCOPE OF USING COMPUTER BASED LIGHTING SIMULATION TOOL FOR DESIGNING EFFICIENT LUMINAIRE LAYOUT OF A PRODUCTION SPACE IN THE CONTEXT OF DHAKA REGION, BANGLADESH								EUROPEAN SIMULATION AND MODELLING CONFERENCE 2012								301	305						2012	2012	Performance based design approach helps to undertake effective actions for mitigating climate change and formulating green building development schemes. Taking into account the performance of buildings, this paper focuses on the lighting of production spaces of readymade garment factories of Dhaka region. Computer based simulations help to predict the possible efficient lighting design in terms of adequacy of lighting as well as energy consumption. This paper uses a newly available lighting simulation tool `DIALux' to establish its reliability validating the simulated data with the data found from the field survey. This paper also shows the scope of using it for selecting and designing efficient luminaire layout in a production space ensuring both the quality of lighting and optimising energy consumption.

Grassland Science in Europe		17				762	764						2012	2012	The European project Multisward aims to increase reliance on grasslands and on multi-species swards for competitive and sustainable ruminant production systems. This contributes to food security and enhanced environmental goods. As part of Multisward, an inventory was made of requirements and expectations of stakeholders with respect to the multi-functionality of grasslands in EU countries. The traditional foursome of primary producer, policy maker, research and advice were identified as the most important stakeholders, followed by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (nature, environment), education and industry. A first international stakeholder consultation revealed the appreciation of current and future functions of grasslands in Europe. In general the economic functions of grasslands, mainly feed for herbivores, were considered the most important. Stakeholders expected this to remain unchanged in future. Environmental functions of grasslands were placed second: water quality and quantity, adaptation to climate change, mitigation and biodiversity. Finally, social services were mentioned.					24th General Meeting of the European-Grassland-Federation24th General Meeting of the European-Grassland-Federation	JUN 03-07, 2012JUN 03-07, 2012	Kuhn; Ministerstwo Rolnictwa Rozwoju Wsi; Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka S A; Karol Kania Synowie; Rolimpex; Dept Rolnictwa Srodowiska Urzedu Marszalkowskiego Wojewodztwa; Lubelskiego; Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa; Powiat Bilgorajski; Centinas; DSV Polska; Perla Browary Lubelskie; Lubella; Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie; Miasto Lublin; Apis; Herbapol Lublin S A; OSM Krasnystaw; Powiat Krasnostawski; Powiat Lubelski; Powiat Krasnystaw; Lubelska Izba Rolnicza; Gmina Krasnystaw; Urzad Miasta KrasnystawKuhn; Ministerstwo Rolnictwa Rozwoju Wsi; Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka S A; Karol Kania Synowie; Rolimpex; Dept Rolnictwa Srodowiska Urzedu Marszalkowskiego Wojewodztwa; Lubelskiego; Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa; Powiat Bilgorajski; Centinas; DSV Polska; Perla Browary Lubelskie; Lubella; Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie; Miasto Lublin; Apis; Herbapol Lublin S A; OSM Krasnystaw; Powiat Krasnostawski; Powiat Lubelski; Powiat Krasnystaw; Lubelska Izba Rolnicza; Gmina Krasnystaw; Urzad Miasta Krasnystaw	Lublin, POLANDLublin, POLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1			978-83-89250-77-3	WOS:000361159300205		J	Um, Jung-Sup; 김기열								Comparative Evaluation of Albedo Distribution according to  Administrative Boundary Using MODIS Products			MODIS 영상을 이용한 행정구역별 알베도 분포 비교평가					Journal of Environmental Impact Assessment	환경영향평가			21	2			265	277						2012	2012	This paper is primarily intended to present quantitative evidences for land surface albedo difference among seven metropolitan cites in South Korea. An empirical study for experimental sites was conducted to confirm how a standard MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument offers the viable method of measuring and comparing the regional heterogeneity of albedo among administrative districts. The metropolitan cities like Seoul located in dense building environment do result in much lower albedo than those exposed in much more sub-urban surface (e.g KwangJoo). These experimental results indicate that an urban surface such as building and road is a crucial explanatory variable for lower albedo. It is confirmed that the urban surface such as building and road could be employed as a proxy of the lower albedo burden in the metropolitan area. It is anticipated that this research output could be used as a valuable reference to confirm the potential of introducing the new concept of“ administrative districts specific albedo management”to support more scientific and objective decision-making in the process of GHG (Greenhouse Gas) reduction project.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1225-7184			KJD:ART001657517		J	SHIN, MINSOO; 황두홍								IT Convergence Technology in Plant Growing for Low-Carbon Green Industry			그린산업 육성을 위한 농업분야 IT융합기술					Journal of Information Technology Services	한국IT서비스학회지			11	4			123	134		10.9716/KITS.2012.11.4.123				2012	2012	Recently, The Bali Road Map was approved, as it demands that developing countries should also have the responsibility of greenhouse gas reduction from 2013.

In a period when fast learning curves for carbon dioxide capture technologies can be expected, it is important that gas plants built as capture ready are able to incorporate technology developments that occur during the period of time when the plant operates without capture. This paper focuses on carbon dioxide capture from combined cycle gas turbine plants and extends concepts previously proposed by the authors for capture-ready designs to include novel options capable of covering a wide range of solvent properties. These options avoid locking in power plants to a specific solvent technology at the time of commissioning and effectively act as a hedge against risk associated with technology obsolescence at the time of retrofitting. They follow the general principles of capture-ready design of low additional capital cost, no upfront performance penalty, good performance with capture and the ability to operate with the capture unit bypassed. Particularly in countries not yet committed to carbon dioxide capture and geological storage, power plant developers may want to keep their retrofit options open by building plants capable of fitting radically different solvents from current state-of-the-art amines.									7	0	0	0	0	7	0	5	1751-4223	1751-4231		WOS:000208869800003		J	Walker, Rae; Hassall, John; Chaplin, Sue; Congues, Janet; Bajayo, Rachael; Mason, Wendy								Health promotion interventions to address climate change using a primary health care approach: a literature review								HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA				22		SI		S6	S12						DEC 2011	2011	Issue addressed: This project explored the literature in which key concepts in primary health care and health promotion are overtly applied to the problem of climate change. This paper contains a discussion of the literature relevant to health promotion principles and intervention strategies for addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation in the primary health care sector. The concept of primary health care is that used by the World Health Organization, based on the Declaration of Alma Ata and often referred to as comprehensive primary health care to differentiate it from primary medical care.Methods: This was a review of literature identified in electronic databases using two sets of search terms. Set A consisted of 'climate change or global warming or greenhouse effect' and set B consisted of 11 key concepts in primary health care and health promotion, for example community resilience, health promotion, social change, food security and economic development. Relevant literature was identified at the intersection of search term A with a term from set B. A search was completed for each set B term.Results: This paper reports a discussion of major categories of health promotion interventions, namely health communication, community building and settings approaches and uses examples drawn from literature on community resilience and summer heat. These interventions are all applicable to the primary health care sector.Conclusion: There is a small literature on health promotion interventions for climate change mitigation and adaptation but it is incomplete and scattered across many sources. An important area for further research is to link the logic of service provision in primary health care to the logic of mitigation and adaptation in a changing environment. Interventions that link the logic must also link diverse services to provide coherent action on local and domestic scales, the scales at which primary health care acts. Another research gap is in regard to institutional change in the primary health care sector. How do the patterns of knowledge, practice and values need to change in the array of organisations that make up comprehensive primary health care?									9	0	0	2	0	9	0	16	1036-1073			WOS:000298723900003	22518912	J	Beccherle, Julien; Tirole, Jean								Regional initiatives and the cost of delaying binding climate change agreements								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS				95	11-12			1339	1348		10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.04.007				DEC 2011	2011	The Kyoto and Copenhagen Protocols on climate change mitigation postponed the specification of binding commitments to a future negotiation. This paper analyzes the strategic implications of delayed negotiations. While, as is well-understood, the incentive to free ride leads to excessive emissions prior to a binding agreement, the cost of delay is magnified by players' attempt to secure a favorable bargaining position in the future negotiation. A "brinkmanship", an "effort substitution", and a "raising rival's cost" effects all concur to generate high post-agreement emissions. The paper applies this general insight to the issuance of forward or bankable permits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The safe range of light to avoid exposing the eye to potentially damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation is 2000 to 3500K and greater than 500 nanometers. Some fluorescent lights fall outside this safe range.Fluorescent lighting may increase UV-related eye diseases by up to 12% and, according to our calculations, may cause an additional 3000 cases of cataracts and 7500 cases of pterygia annually in Australia.Greater control of UV exposure from fluorescent lights is required. This may be of particular concern for aging populations in developed countries and countries in northern latitudes where there is a greater dependence on artificial lighting.

This residential model remains very popular among middle class households, in spite of the relevant costs and impacts related to its functioning. Local authorities are increasingly concerned with its associated impacts, even when they do not have clear planning strategies.The case study presented is about a municipality that is part of the Catania Metropolitan Area, in Italy. Built up areas cover more than 50% of the municipality's total land and the prevailing development type is the detached single family home. The existing settlement pattern is essentially an "automobile city" for about 20.000 inhabitants with a very limited presence of services. The analyses conducted show that this settlement is unsustainable, not in terms of insufficient green areas, or permeable soils but because it lacks any urban quality. The resulting impact on the environment is considerable both in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the contribution to urban water runoff.The paper presents the first results of a consulting activity for the local municipality that is revising its General Master Plan. This activity, conducted by the University of Catania, includes a set of analyses based on land use data and the definition of general planning criteria. The aim is develop a proposal, based on principles of sustainable urban planning, that can effect a change towards a new pattern of urban development characterised by densification, mixed use planning and reduced private car dependence by concentrating new services in pedestrian oriented areas. The challenge of the proposal presented is to define a set of specific rules that can limit the uncontrolled sprawl by contextualising these general and widely accepted principles to local conditions.

Vulnerability to climate change is determined by a community's ability to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact of major weather events. Climate change will affect industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as transportation, health, and energy infrastructure. These shifts will have significant health and economic consequences for diverse communities throughout California. Without proactive policies to address these equity concerns, climate change will likely reinforce and amplify current as well as future socioeconomic disparities, leaving low-income, minority, and politically marginalized groups with fewer economic opportunities and more environmental and health burdens. This review explores the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups in California and investigates the costs and benefits of the climate change mitigation strategies specified for implementation in the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32).

When poorly managed, through inappropriate health care waste management systems, they can cause adverse effects to human health and the environment.This paper presents an evaluation of health care waste management systems in Cameroon, based on a survey of five health care facilities in the Southwestern Region of Cameroon. It is established that health care waste collection and handling systems including containers and bins for segregated wastes are generally in a poor state. A proportion of the waste stream is disposed of in open dumps in combination with municipal solid wastes while some are disposed of in incinerators which are often poorly designed.The waste stream is complex and heterogeneous with an average waste generation rate estimated at 4.4.9 kg/day equivalent to over 16 tonnes/annum comprising 49%, 16% and 14% of general, infectious and sharps respectively for a typical Health Care Facility in Buea which is a medium densely populated town. There is the potential to recover materials from this waste stream. if adequate waste management systems are developed and implemented. Separately recovering the uncontaminated general waste stream for a secondary market ultimately contributes to resource efficiencies and conservation of scarce natural resources. Reducing the waste quantities being incinerated results in less potential for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and greenhouse gases to be released into the environment, thus contributing to global environmental benefits through climate change mitigation and pollution reduction.The study establishes that the little attention given to medical waste management results from a lack of an integrated approach to policy making at the highest level of decision-making. There is the need for legislation to allow for a more defined roles and responsibilities for health care personnel responsible for the handling and disposal of the waste streams at the point of generation in the health care facilities. Overall, there is the need to formulate more sustainable health care waste management legislation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Our study evaluates the environmental consequences of waste prevention on waste management systems and on the wider society, using life-cycle thinking. The partial prevention of unsolicited mail, beverage packaging and food waste is tested for a "High-tech" waste management system relying on high energy and material recovery and for a "Low-tech" waste management system with less recycling and relying on landfilling. Prevention of 13% of the waste mass entering the waste management system generates a reduction of loads and savings in the waste management system for the different impacts categories; 45% net reduction for nutrient enrichment and 12% reduction for global warming potential. When expanding our system and including avoided production incurred by the prevention measures, large savings are observed (15-fold improvement for nutrient enrichment and 2-fold for global warming potential). Prevention of food waste has the highest environmental impact saving. Prevention generates relatively higher overall relative benefit for "Low-tech" systems depending on landfilling. The paper provides clear evidence of the environmental benefits of waste prevention and has specific relevance in climate change mitigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnosis of the public goods failure associated with particular ecosystem services is critical to the development of the appropriate international response. There are two categories of international environmental public goods that are most likely to be undersupplied. One has an additive supply technology and the other has a weakest link supply technology. The degree to which the collective response should be targeted depends on the importance of supply from any one country. In principle, the solution for the undersupply lies in payments designed to compensate local providers for the additional costs they incur in meeting global demand. Targeted support may take the form of direct investment in supply (the Global Environment Facility model) or of payments for the benefits of supply (the Payments for Ecosystem Services model).									11	0	0	3	0	11	1	36	0044-7447			WOS:000298500100006	22338717	J	Mason, Robert J.

Faced with immense political and economic challenges, however, it subsequently transformed itself, taking a more collaborative, less regulatory tack. Ecoregional planning capacity has expanded, though highly unevenly, at multiple spatial scales. Today's multiple initiatives receive financial, technical, and logistical support from federal and state funding programs, land trusts, watershed organizations, and ballot questions-and they may be further bolstered by climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. As they continue to develop, ecoregional programs must contend with issues of equity, efficiency, affordability, and intense opposition.									4	0	0	1	0	4	2	18	0885-4122			WOS:000298746500002		J	Stephens-Romero, Shane D.; Brown, Tim M.; Carreras-Sospedra, Marc; Kang, Jee E.; Brouwer, Jacob; Dabdub, Donald; Recker, Wilfred W.; Samuelsen, G.

Advanced infrastructure planning can minimize the cost of hydrogen infrastructure while assuring that energy and environment benefits are achieved. This study presents a comprehensive advanced planning methodology for the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure, and applies the methodology to delineate fully built-out infrastructure strategies, assess the associated energy and environment impacts, facilitate the identification of an optimal infrastructure roll-out strategy, and identify the potential for renewable hydrogen feedstocks. The South Coast Air Basin of California, targeted by automobile manufacturers for the first regional commercial deployment of FCEVs, is the focus for the study. The following insights result from the application of the methodology:Compared to current gasoline stations, only 11%-14% of the number of hydrogen fueling stations can provide comparable accessibility to drivers in a targeted region.To meet reasonable capacity demand for hydrogen fueling, approximately 30% the number of hydrogen stations are required compared to current gasoline stations.Replacing gasoline vehicles with hydrogen FCEVs has the potential to (1) reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by more than 80%, reduce energy requirements by 42%, and virtually eliminate petroleum consumption from the passenger vehicle sector, and (2) significantly reduce urban concentrations of ozone and PM2.5.Existing sources of biomethane in the California South Coast Air Basin can provide up to 30% of the hydrogen fueling demand for a fully built-out hydrogen FCEV scenario.A step-wise transition of judiciously located existing gasoline stations to dispense and accommodate the increasing demand for hydrogen addresses proactively key infrastructure deployment challenges including a viable business model, zoning, permitting, and public acceptance.

Due to its tropical location, dense urban morphology and higher than average density of population, buildings in Dhaka are likely to be adversely affected by the projected changes in climate, in particular by the increases in temperature. Buildings play a vital role in most aspects of our lives and their energy consumption patterns affect climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. It is important to understand the likely impact of the projected increases in temperature on cooling and heating requirements in buildings in future climates. In this research, global projections on changes in temperature are temporally downscaled using a statistically averaged baseline present-day hourly weather data to generate future weather data in three timeslices: 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Time series data for the present-day and future climates are analyzed as well as heating and cooling degree-days are calculated.Analysis shows that heating degree-days decrease whereas cooling degree-days continue to increase in future climates. The magnitude of change in monthly cooling degree-days is uneven and is greater in winter months than in summer and monsoon. Increased occurrences of temperatures above comfort threshold throughout the year are likely to have significant consequences for human health and wellbeing. The severity and duration of outdoor temperatures in the form of increased cooling degree-days in future climates will result in a surge in demand for energy for comfort cooling, which will add further stress to the already stressed energy infrastructure in the country. Prompt actions from stakeholders are, therefore, essential to enhance the resilience of Dhaka's buildings to climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Research is underway to find new biofuel technologies that mitigate climate change and can be produced sustainably and economically. Following an 18-month inquiry, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics has developed an ethical framework for biofuels policy-making. Based on a number of widely held ethical values, six ethical principles are introduced that should be considered in biofuels policy-making. Many current biofuels policies fail this ethical test. An overarching ethical standard for biofuels is proposed that includes the protection of human rights and the environment, full life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions, trade principles that are fair, access and benefit-sharing schemes to encourage equitable distribution of costs and benefits, and instruments to incentivize the development of promising new approaches. The Council goes on to make recommendations for changes to current policy.

Clean Development Dams in Himachal Pradesh, India								MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT				31	4			293	304		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00054.1				NOV 2011	2011	The carbon-offsetting scheme Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) has evolved into one of the most important instruments for the funding of renewable energy projects in mountain regions in developing and newly industrializing countries. The CDM allows industrialized states to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions by investing in climate change mitigation activities abroad. These offsetting projects are intended to avoid emissions while simultaneously contributing to sustainable development at the local level. The most common project type under the CDM is hydropower, with the majority of projects being located in the mountain areas of China and India. However, doubts about the scrutinizing methods of the CDM as well as the often controversial impacts of dam building on mountain environments and communities raise questions about the ability of these "clean development" dams to serve as a sustainable means of mitigating climate change. The objective of the present article is to assess the effectiveness of large CDM hydropower projects in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Analysis of planning documents and expert interviews revealed that "clean development" dams in the Himachal Himalaya fall short of achieving the goals of the CDM. Most projects are not in a position to compensate for emissions because they would have been built even without CDM support. Furthermore, it is arguable whether CDM dams contribute to sustainable mountain development, because the consequences of their construction are the same as for many other ordinary large dams, that is, environmental damage and conflicts that arise from the reallocation of land and water resources. Our results suggest that the promotion of large hydropower projects through the CDM in its current form is a highly ambivalent strategy. Shortcomings in the regulatory framework of the CDM may be undermining the environmental and social integrity of the CDM at both the global and local levels.									24	0	0	1	0	24	0	24	0276-4741			WOS:000298349900003		J	Salmi, Olli; Wierink, Maaria				Salmi, Olli/C-9831-2015				Effects of waste recovery on carbon footprint: a case study of the Gulf of Bothnia steel and zinc industries								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				19	16	SI		1857	1864		10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.04.014				NOV 2011	2011	This article analyses the impact of waste recovery on climate change mitigation on a regional scale. We focus on the EU End of Waste (EoW) policy, which aims at reducing negative impacts on the environment through the minimization of generated waste. At the same time, the EU climate objectives set challenging goals for the industry to lower greenhouse gas emissions. We argue that the goals of these two policies are conflicting: under certain circumstances, the EoW will lead into increased greenhouse gas emissions because of a number of negative feedback effects that function on multiple spatial and temporal scales.To assess the effects of waste recovery on greenhouse gas emissions, we carry out a consequential life-cycle inventory on a proposed industrial ecosystem around the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden. The system recovers currently unutilized steelmaking dust and slag from four steel mills in Finland and Sweden and converts them into iron and zinc raw materials in a novel rotary hearth furnace. The recovered iron is led back into the blast furnace of one of the steel mills and zinc is treated in an existing zinc plant. In the European scale, the model system is significant in size, serving thus as a model for integrated EoW and carbon footprint assessments in other similar cases within the EU.The analysis reveals the relative greenhouse gas emissions from raw material extraction and production, heat and power generation, transport and the production process itself, in comparison to the present system with limited material recovery. To test the model viability, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to increasing energy and production capacity. Our analysis shows that from the point of view of a single operator, material recovery may bring noteworthy reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. If the scale of the assessment is expanded beyond the confines of a single plant, however, we find limited potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through further recovery of steelmaking residues. In conclusion, we provide policy recommendations with which the EoW paradigm can provide better support for climate change mitigation on a regional scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, the optimization is able to study the integration of CO(2) capture processes with power systems for minimizing site-wide fuel consumption. Typical operating conditions for I precombustion as well as postcombustion CO(2) capture have been applied to estimate energy demand within the CO(2) capture; process. The power system is designed not only to meet the electricity and shaft power demand from the background process but also to satisfy the additional energy requirement incurred by CO(2) removal. With the energy integration for the overall systems, the fuel consumption could be reduced, and operating cost, minimized. A case study is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology for the design of energy and power systems in liquid natural gas (LNG) plants, under a carbon-constrained business environment.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	0888-5885			WOS:000295237000036		J	Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus; Dannenmann, Michael				Dannenmann, Michael/A-7278-2013; Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/A-8081-2013	Butterbach-Bahl, Klaus/0000-0001-9499-6598			Denitrification and associated soil N2O emissions due to agricultural activities in a changing climate								CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY				3	5			389	395		10.1016/j.cosust.2011.08.004				OCT 2011	2011	Human activities have accelerated global nitrogen cycling by approx. a factor of two. Also under future environmental conditions, agricultural nitrogen use is expected to remain the leading cause of reactive nitrogen (N-r) release to the environment. The main process to remove N-r from the environment is microbial denitrification. Here we summarize potential mechanisms that may affect denitrification and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in/from agricultural systems under future environmental conditions. Though changes in climate, specifically in temperature and precipitation, are likely to directly affect denitrification rates and N2O emissions, we identified several indirect mechanisms of global change that may potentially override direct effects. Among these are a) landscape scale changes of hotspots of denitrification: while the importance of non-hydromorphic upland soils for denitrification may decrease owing to limitations in soil moisture the importance of riparian areas as denitrification hotspots may further increase owing to the increased likeliness of flooding events leading to more frequent occurrences of aerobic-anaerobic cycles in riparian areas and, thus, increased denitrification, b) increased provision of labile carbon substrates via plant root exudation in the rhizosphere under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, leading to increased microbial activity and higher denitrification rates in agricultural subsoils, thereby potentially reducing rates of nitrate leaching from agricultural soils and c) increased ammonia (NH3) volatilization from agricultural systems leading to increased denitrification rates and N2O emissions downwind from NH3 emission sources. Obviously, under future environmental conditions the mentioned mechanisms would further strengthen the regional disjunction of areas of N-r application from those of N-r removal by denitrlfication, thereby calling for a reappraisal of the importance of indirect emissions of N2O from agricultural N-r use. It remains unclear, to which extent climate change mitigation options such as the introduction of no-till systems or the increasing use of slow release fertilizers in conjunction with nitrification inhibitors or the adaptations of agricultural management practices to climate change such as altered timing of cultivation, choice of crop varieties and adaptation of water saving production systems may finally override direct and indirect climate change effects on denitrification and N2O emissions from agricultural systems.									62	1	0	44	0	62	7	196	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000296686300013		J	Rodriguez, R.; Fernandez, A.

Three effects on regional consumption losses are distinguished: domestic measures, trade of fossil energy carriers and trade of emission permits. Key results are: (i) GDP losses and a redirection of investments in the energy system towards capital-intensive technologies are major contributions to regional consumption losses. (ii) A devaluation of tradable fossil energy endowments contributes largely to the mitigation costs of fossil fuel exporters. (iii) In case of reduced availability of low-carbon technologies, the permit market volume and associated monetary redistributions increase. The results suggest that the availability of a broad portfolio of low-carbon technologies could facilitate negotiations on the permit allocation scheme in a global cap-and-trade system.

Despite urbanization being a major driver of land-use change globally, there have been few attempts to quantify and map ecosystem service provision at a city-wide scale. One service that is an increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies, and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage.2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above-ground carbon stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom-up management of private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing top-down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city.3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the above-ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3.16 kg C m(-2) of urban area, with 97.3% of this carbon pool being associated with trees rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation.4. Domestic gardens store just 0.76 kg C m(-2), which is not significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0.14 kg C m(-2)). The greatest above-ground carbon density is 28.86 kg C m(-2), which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned/managed sites.5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue Leicester's contribution by an order of magnitude.6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city-wide scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing above-ground vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized European city.									192	12	0	121	3	209	7	287	0021-8901			WOS:000295095100008		J	Friel, Sharon; Akerman, Marco; Hancock, Trevor; Kumaresan, Jacob; Marmot, Michael; Melin, Thomas; Vlahov, David		GRNUHE		Agarwal, Siddharth/L-5337-2015; AKERMAN, MARCO/J-7575-2012; Marmot, M G/Y-3920-2019	Agarwal, Siddharth/0000-0002-4293-435X; Marmot, M G/0000-0002-2431-6419; Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435			Addressing the Social and Environmental Determinants of Urban Health Equity: Evidence for Action and a Research Agenda								JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE				88	5			860	874		10.1007/s11524-011-9606-1				OCT 2011	2011	Urban living is the new reality for the majority of the world's population. Urban change is taking place in a context of other global challenges-economic globalization, climate change, financial crises, energy and food insecurity, old and emerging armed conflicts, as well as the changing patterns of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. These health and social problems, in countries with different levels of infrastructure and health system preparedness, pose significant development challenges in the 21st century. In all countries, rich and poor, the move to urban living has been both good and bad for population health, and has contributed to the unequal distribution of health both within countries (the urban-rural divide) and within cities (the rich-poor divide). In this series of papers, we demonstrate that urban planning and design and urban social conditions can be good or bad for human health and health equity depending on how they are set up. We argue that climate change mitigation and adaptation need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to achieve health equity through action in the social determinants. And we highlight how different forms of governance can shape agendas, policies, and programs in ways that are inclusive and health-promoting or perpetuate social exclusion, inequitable distribution of resources, and the inequities in health associated with that. While today we can describe many of the features of a healthy and sustainable city, and the governance and planning processes needed to achieve these ends, there is still much to learn, especially with respect to tailoring these concepts and applying them in the cities of lower- and middle-income countries. By outlining an integrated research agenda, we aim to assist researchers, policy makers, service providers, and funding bodies/donors to better support, coordinate, and undertake research that is organized around a conceptual framework that positions health, equity, and sustainability as central policy goals for urban management.									33	0	0	0	1	33	2	49	1099-3460			WOS:000295866900003	21877255	J	Ulusik, Ahmet								Advantages and disadvantages of biodiesels								ENERGY EDUCATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART A-ENERGY SCIENCE AND RESEARCH				28	1			221	226						OCT 2011	2011	In 2000, biodiesel became the only alternative engine fuel in the petroleum poor countries. The biodiesel industry has contributed significantly to the domestic economy. Sustainable energy supply is necessary for the economic development of a country. The direct use of vegetable oils in fuel engines is problematic. Vegetable oils can be used as fuel for combustion engines, but its viscosity is much higher than usual diesel fuel and requires modifications of the engines. The viscosity and other specific properties of biodiesel are close to diesel fuels. There are many benefits the environment, economy and consumers in using biodiesels. The benefits include greenhouse gas reductions including reduced carbon dioxide emissions, which will contribute to domestic and international targets, the diversification of the fuel sector, biodegradability, sustainability, and an additional market for agricultural products.									17	0	0	0	0	17	1	35	1308-772X			WOS:000291125500023		J	Komarek, Timothy M.; Lupi, Frank; Kaplowitz, Michael D.

Coupled with the possibility of future regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, firms and institutions have begun to critically evaluate their own carbon footprint. This paper examines the preferences of stakeholders within a large academic institution for attributes of alternative greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategies. The attributes considered by constituents include: the fuel portfolio mix, effort for conserving energy use, carbon emissions reduction, timeframe for emissions reduction to be achieved and cost. We use a choice experiment technique that enables the examination of greenhouse gas reduction program attribute preferences across three constituent groups. The results show that each of the constituent groups have a positive WTP for carbon emissions reductions and prefer investments in reductions in the shorter- rather than longer-term. The results also suggest differences between the constituent groups in their WTP for types of fuels in the fuel portfolio. Finally, we use the results to examine the welfare implications of different combinations of the policy attributes that coincide with alternative GHG program strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In the short term, expanding the use of mature technologies in conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles is the most realistic, effective, and timely solution for China to meeting the urgent challenges of energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction; while in the long run biofuel is a promising candidate due to their renewability and carbon neutrality.

Ozone is the air pollutant most consistently projected to increase under future climate change.Purpose: To project future pediatric asthma emergency department visits associated with ground-level ozone changes, comparing 1990s to 2020s.Methods: This study assessed future numbers of asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years using (1) baseline New York City metropolitan area emergency department rates; (2) a dose-response relationship between ozone levels and pediatric asthma emergency department visits; and (3) projected daily 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations for the 2020s as simulated by a global-to-regional climate change and atmospheric chemistry model. Sensitivity analyses included population projections and ozone precursor changes. This analysis occurred in 2010.Results: In this model, climate change could cause an increase in regional summer ozone-related asthma emergency department visits for children aged 0-17 years of 7.3% across the New York City metropolitan region by the 2020s. This effect diminished with inclusion of ozone precursor changes. When population growth is included, the projections of morbidity related to ozone are even larger.Conclusions: The results of this analysis demonstrate that the use of regional climate and atmospheric chemistry models make possible the projection of local climate change health effects for specific age groups and specific disease outcomes, such as emergency department visits for asthma. Efforts should be made to improve on this type of modeling to inform local and wider-scale climate change mitigation and adaptation policy.

Literature covering six main impact sectors is reviewed: sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal impacts, ocean acidification, ecosystems and biodiversity, water resources and desertification, agriculture and food security, and human health. The review focuses on studies with a global perspective to climate change impacts assessment, although in the absence of global studies for some sectors or aspects of impacts, national and regional studies are cited. The review highlights three major emerging themes which are of importance for the policy- and decision-making process: (1) a movement towards probabilistic methods of impacts assessment and/or the consideration of climate modelling uncertainty; (2) a move towards assessing potential impacts that could be avoided under different climate change mitigation scenarios relative to a business-as-usual reference scenario; and (3) uncertainties that remain in understanding the relationship between climate and natural or human systems. Whether recent impact assessments show a changed risk of damage to human or natural systems since the AR4 depends upon the impact sector; whether the assessments are robust or not (i.e. will stand the test of time) requires additional expert judgement. However, using this judgement, overall we find an increased risk to natural systems, and in some components of human systems.									34	0	0	22	0	35	0	140	0309-1333	1477-0296		WOS:000292888900002		J	Britz, Wolfgang; Hertel, Thomas W.

This paper contributes to this literature by developing a new methodology to link two widely used policy models in order to provide an integrated assessment of the environmental impacts of EU biofuels mandates. By combining the CAPRI model of EU agricultural production and resource use with the GTAP model of global trade and land use, we are able to estimate both the global impacts of EU biofuels policies as well as the detailed, regional changes in land use and nutrient surplus. The applicability of this combined modeling approach extends well beyond biofuels. It could offer important insights into the global impacts of EU agricultural policy reforms, as well as analysis of the EU-regional impacts of global agreements on trade policy or climate change mitigation. In short, the methodology developed in this paper holds great promise for future, cross-scale analysis of global issues bearing on agriculture, land use and the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

One physical mechanism by which this could occur is capillary trapping of discrete pore-scale CO2 bubbles (referred to as ganglia) in the pore space. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques were used to quantify the spatial distribution and pore environment of such CO2 entrapment in a model porous medium (random glass bead packing). 3D images revealed a relatively macroscopically homogeneous CO2 entrapment, even though the image resolution is insufficient to resolve individual CO2 ganglia. Quantification of the pore environment of the CO2 ganglia was achieved using NMR displacement propagators (displacement probability distributions), acquired both before and after CO2 entrapment. Lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations were used to facilitate interpretation of the propagator statistics by considering various pore environments in which CO2 could become trapped. Comparison with the experimental data suggests that CO2 is preferentially entrapped in comparatively larger pores.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have been correlated with climate change, and carbon capture is essential to enable the continuing use of fossil fuels while reducing the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere thereby mitigating global climate changes. Among the proposed methods of CO2 capture, oxyfuel combustion technology provides a promising option, which is applicable to power generation systems. This technology is based on combustion with pure oxygen (O-2) instead of air, resulting in flue gas that consists mainly of CO2 and water (H2O), that latter can be separated easily via condensation, while removing other contaminants leaving pure CO2 for storage. However, fuel combustion in pure O-2 results in intolerably high combustion temperatures. In order to provide the dilution effect of the absent nitrogen (N-2) and to moderate the furnace/combustor temperatures, part of the flue gas is recycled back into the combustion chamber. An efficient source of O-2 is required to make oxycombustion a competitive CO2 capture technology. Conventional O-2 production utilizing the cryogenic distillation process is energetically expensive. Ceramic membranes made from mixed ion-electronic conducting oxides have received increasing attention because of their potential to mitigate the cost of O-2 production, thus helping to promote these clean energy technologies. Some effort has also been expended in using these membranes to improve the performance of the O-2 separation processes by combining air separation and high-temperature oxidation into a single chamber. This paper provides a review of the performance of combustors utilizing oxy-fuel combustion process, materials utilized in ion-transport membranes and the integration of such reactors in power cycles. The review is focused on carbon capture potential, developments of oxyfuel applications and O-2 separation and combustion in membrane reactors. The recent developments in oxyfuel power cycles are discussed focusing on the main concepts of manipulating exergy flows within each cycle and the reported thermal efficiencies.

This paper attempts to address this question by investigating the driving forces of transport demand and relevant policy measures that facilitate mitigating GHG emissions in the urban transport sector in Indian cities based on a critical review of the literature. Our overview of existing literature and international experiences suggests that it is critical to improve urban governance in transport infrastructure quality and develop efficient public transport, coupled with integrated land use/transport planning as well as economic instruments. This will allow Indian cities to embark on a sustainable growth pathway by decoupling transport services demand of GHG emissions in the longer term. Appropriate policy instruments need to be selected to reconcile the imperatives of economic and urban growth, aspiration to higher quality of life, improvements in social welfare, urban transport-related energy consumption and GHG emissions mitigation target in Indian cities.

Climate change: a crop protection challenge for the twenty-first century								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				67	6			691	696		10.1002/ps.2109				JUN 2011	2011	Convincing data now show that temperatures are increasing, and that changing precipitation patterns are already affecting agriculture. Predicted future impacts vary by region, but all are projected to suffer productivity declines by the late twenty-first century unless successful mitigation measures are implemented soon. Exacerbating the climate change challenge, doubling of overall crop productivity will be required by mid-century. Clearly, crop protection will become increasingly difficult as higher-yielding varieties present a larger and more tempting target to all pests, and the pests themselves extend their ranges poleward and into other new geographies owing to reduced winter kill and longer growing seasons. Fortunately, good progress on enhancing crop protection technology to meet these challenges is already being made, but the scope of this climatic provocation is such that complacency is not an option. Increased investment into new technologies and adoption of new agricultural practices with improved adaptive and mitigation potential are both essential.

The amount of CMM generated at a specific operation depends on the productivity of the coal mine, the gassiness of the coal seam and any underlying and overlying formations, operational variables, and geological conditions. CMM can be captured by engineered boreholes that augment the mine's ventilation system or it can be emitted into the mine environment and exhausted from the mine shafts along with ventilation air. The large amounts of methane released during mining present concerns about adequate mine ventilation to ensure worker safety, but they also can create opportunities to generate energy if this gas is captured and utilized properly. This article reviews the technical aspects of CMM capture in and from coal mines, the main factors affecting CMM accumulations in underground coal mines, methods for capturing methane using boreholes, specific borehole designs for effective methane capture, aspects of removing methane from abandoned mines and from sealed/active gobs of operating mines, benefits of capturing and controlling CMM for mine safety, and benefits for energy production and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction.

However, climate change mitigation policies are widely perceived to have regressive effects - that is, putting a higher financial burden as a proportion of household income on poor than on rich households. This is one of several major barriers to the adoption of effective mitigation policies. They would also have considerable social justice implications requiring significant welfare state responses. We assess the claim that climate change policies have regressive effects by comparing different types of mitigation policies. We will argue that many of these are indeed likely to have regressive distributional implications but that there are several policy options to counteract regressive effects.									30	0	0	5	0	30	1	22	0261-0183			WOS:000289476500007		J	Kim, So Young				Kim, So Young/C-1674-2011	Kim, So Young/0000-0002-6970-3877			Public Perceptions of Climate Change and Support for Climate Policies in Asia: Evidence from Recent Polls								JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES				70	2			319	331		10.1017/S0021911811000064				MAY 2011	2011	Climate change has become a focal point in recent environmental debates and policymaking. Latest polls show rising consensus among the global public on the urgency of the problem. Home to the fastest growing economies as well as to four of the ten largest greenhouse gas emitters, Asia holds key to successful global coordination on climate change policy. This essay draws a contour of Asian public opinion on climate change issues based on multiple cross-national polls. While generally aware of climate change and seriously concerned about its effects, Asians turn out to be the least willing to bear the costs of climate change mitigation as compared to the residents of other regions of the world. This portends a great hurdle to devising and implementing proactive policies to address the challenges of climate change in the region.									13	0	0	1	0	13	1	8	0021-9118			WOS:000292473500002		J	Victor, Peter; Jackson, Tim								Doing the maths on the green economy								NATURE				472	7343			295	295		10.1038/472295a				APR 21 2011	2011										5	0	0	1	0	5	0	21	0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000289724600019	21512560	J	Jiang, Leiwen; Hardee, Karen								How do Recent Population Trends Matter to Climate Change?

Population is rarely mentioned in policy debates on climate change. Studies in the past decade have added significantly to understanding the mechanisms and complexity of population and climate interactions. In addition to the growth of total population size, research shows that changes in population composition (i.e. age, urban-rural residence, and household structure) generate substantial effects on the climate system. Moreover, studies by the impact, vulnerability and adaptation (IAV) community also reveal that population dynamics are critical in the near term for building climate change resilience and within adaptation strategies. This paper explores how global population dynamics affect carbon emissions and climate systems, how recent demographic trends matter to worldwide efforts to adapt to climate change, and how population policies could make differences for climate change mitigation and adaptation.									46	3	0	10	3	52	1	64	0167-5923	1573-7829		WOS:000288555000006		J	Timilsina, Govinda R.; Shrestha, Ashish								How much hope should we have for biofuels?								ENERGY				36	4	SI		2055	2069		10.1016/j.energy.2010.08.023				APR 2011	2011	This paper revisits the recent developments in biofuel markets and their economic, social and environmental impacts. Several countries have introduced mandates and targets for biofuel expansion. Production, international trade and investment have increased sharply in the last few years. However, some analysts linked biofuels to the 2007-2008 global food crisis. Existing studies diverge on the magnitude of the projected long-term impacts of biofuels on food prices and supply, with studies that model only the agricultural sector showing higher impacts and studies that model the entire economy showing relatively lower impacts. In terms of climate change mitigation, biofuels reduces GHG emissions only if GHG emissions related to land-use change are avoided. When biofuel production entails conversion of forest to cropland, net reduction of GHG would not be realized for many years. Existing literature does not favor the diversion of food for large-scale biofuels production, but the regulated expansion of biofuels in countries with surplus lands and a strong biofuel industry cannot be ruled out. Developments in non-food based or cellulosic (or second generation) biofuels may offer some hope, yet they still compete with food supply through land use and are currently constrained by a number of technical and economic barriers.

To prevent possible trade sanctions from the industrialized trading partners, Taiwan proposed several policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. This includes their preparation of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act is under legislature review and the Statute for Renewable Energy Management. Because Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, it is excluded from participation in the United Nation Convention on Climate Change and lacks access to the flexible mechanisms defined under the Kyoto Protocol. The Taiwan Environment Protection Administration plans to encourage the local emitters to acquire foreign reduction credits to offset domestic emissions. This article approaches Taiwan's mitigation policies and measures from an international legal perspective. It also introduces adaptation policies and recommends that the government establish a special national adaptation team to prepare data and criteria for risk prioritization. Finally, this paper recommends that the Parties of the UNFCCC adopt the 'universal apply' principle for climate change and allow any governmental agency whose governing matters are covered by the convention, to participate and share emission-reduction responsibilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1976-9229			WOS:000293059000004		J	Hwang, Jenn Jiang; Chang, Wei Ru				Hwang, Jenn Jiang/C-6156-2008	Hwang, Jenn Jiang/0000-0001-8168-1159			Policy progress in mitigation of climate change in Taiwan								ENERGY POLICY				39	3			1113	1122		10.1016/j.enpol.2010.11.033				MAR 2011	2011	To make an active contribution to the global effort in mitigation of climate change, Taiwan government has implemented the "Frameworks for Sustainable Energy Policy-An Energy-Saving and Carbon-Reduction Action Plan" in June 2008. It has made a commitment of a stepwise reduction of nationwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which returns the nationwide GHG emission to 2008 levels by 2020, then reduces to 2000 levels by 2025, and finally cuts 50% of 2000 levels by 2050. The fundamental strategy is to reduce the GHG emission under acceptable economic development and energy security to achieve generation-spanning triple-win in energy, environment and economy. The major policy instruments such as "Statute for Renewable Energy Development", "GHG Reduction Law (draft)," "Regulation for Energy Tax (draft)," and "Energy Management Act" have been either implemented or scheduled for legislative reviewing. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of the outcomes of GHG emission reduction in Taiwan. In addition, the progress and priority of policy instruments in GHG emission reduction are analyzed as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A report from a Canadian government advisory organization, the National Round Table on Environment and Economy (NRTEE), Achieving 2050: A carbon pricing policy for Canada, recommended "fast and deep" energy pathways to emissions reduction through large-scale electrification of Canada's economy by relying on a major expansion of hydroelectricity, adoption of carbon capture and storage for coal and natural gas, and increasing the use of nuclear.This paper examines the likelihood of the pathways being met by considering the report's proposed energy systems, their associated energy sources, and the magnitude of the changes. It shows that the pathways assume some combination of technological advances, access to secure energy supplies, or rapid installation in order to meet both the 2020 and 2050 targets. This analysis suggests that NRTEE's projections are optimistic and unlikely to be achieved.The analysis described in this paper can be applied to other countries to better understand and develop strategies that can help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Case Study of Green Industries								ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE				21	2			131	142		10.1002/eet.567				MAR-APR 2011	2011	How should we evaluate and regulate the impacts of lobbying in the European Union (EU)? The current lack of transparency around lobbying activities and the absence of formal regulation mean that a hidden lobbying problem may prevail. The tentative case study of green industries in the EU is illustrative. The wind turbine industry, for example, benefits from ambitious environmental target levels for greenhouse gas reductions that will increase the future market for renewable energy. In contrast, for example, no environmental target levels exist that increase the future market shares of organic farming. Rational choice theory suggests that lobbying and group size advantages can explain the observed difference in achieving environmental target levels. The EU may learn from the US legislation as a starting point for a best-practice solution and future evaluation of impacts of lobbying in the EU.

There are several ways of accomplishing this goal, each of which emphasizes actions by a different set of stakeholders. This article argues that building users play a critical but poorly understood and often overlooked role in the built environment. In the face of climate change, the article finds purely architectural solutions, such as those proposed by the Architecture 2030 Challenge, to be necessary but not sufficient to achieve climate change mitigation targets. To fully address the task ahead, it argues that architects need to develop their professional expertise to improve buildings and seek ways of integrating user involvement in building performance. Moreover, from a professional standpoint, this paper suggests it may be wise for architects to claim a leadership role in this area before another group of building professionals does.									132	2	0	2	1	133	8	55	0003-8628			WOS:000288184900003		J	Morrissey, J.; Moore, T.; Horne, R.

Stringency is set to further increase significantly in attempts to meet climate change mitigation goals. However, new regulation is usually met with reticence from sectors of the building industry, one reason being the additional costs implied in meeting higher performance standards for more energy efficient buildings. One low cost option, investigated in this paper, is to orient buildings in order to maximise their passive solar benefits. Using a range of 81 different detached dwelling designs, a modelling experiment was conducted in order to assess the implications of orientation on modelled thermal energy efficiency. Design adaptability to orientation change was modelled across two scenarios; current building energy efficiency standards and pending improved energy efficiency standards. The effect of size and overall energy efficiency rating was included in consideration of variance across orientations. Results show that higher standards are easier to apply to smaller dwellings, and costs are lower. Also, higher performing designs are more flexible across different orientations, producing lower standard deviations of mean ratings. The findings indicate that passive solar design is a concept that can readily be incorporated into house plans at the design stage. Recommendations for further empirical research are also made.

The structural water of the palygorskite dehydrates in the temperature range of 30-625 degrees C, as shown in the thermogravimetric analysis and mass spectrometric curves. The mass spectrometric curves combined the differential thermogravimetric curves enable the detailed determination of the main dehydration steps. The results show that the dehydration occurs in four main steps: (a) elimination of interparticle water and partial zeolitic water at below 110 degrees C, (b) release of the rest part of zeolitic water from the structural layer of palygorskite at about 160 degrees C, (c) dehydration of one part of bound water at about 340 degrees C and (d) loss of the rest part of bound water at around 450 degrees C. The temperatures of dehydration of the palygorskite minerals are found to be influenced by the geological environment and the amount and kind of impurities. The evolved gases in the decomposition process are various because of the different amounts and kind of impurities. It is also found that decarbonization takes place at around 600 degrees C due to the decomposition of calcite and dolomite impurities in these minerals. It is evident by the mass spectrometric curve that the water is given out from the samples and carbon dioxide originates from the impurity calcite and dolomite. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An initial testing of the game shows that engaging with the game strengthened the user's belief that action can be taken to mitigate climate change and increased their support for more transformative social changes to achieve climate mitigation and adaptation.					10th International Conference on Entertainment Computing10th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)10th International Conference on Entertainment Computing10th Biennial Pan Ocean Remote Sensing Conference (PORSEC)	OCT 05-08, 2011OCT, 2010OCT 05-08, 2011OCT, 2010	Natl Ctr Excellence Graph, Animat & NewMedia; Univ British Columbia, Media & Graph Interdisciplinary Ctr; Simon Fraser Univ; IFIP TC14 CommNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst; Taiwan Natl Sci Council; Fisheries (FA); Environm Protect Agcy Taiwan (EPA); Int Space Sci & Res AgenciesNatl Ctr Excellence Graph, Animat & NewMedia; Univ British Columbia, Media & Graph Interdisciplinary Ctr; Simon Fraser Univ; IFIP TC14 CommNatl Taiwan Ocean Univ; Taiwan Ocean Res Inst; Taiwan Natl Sci Council; Fisheries (FA); Environm Protect Agcy Taiwan (EPA); Int Space Sci & Res Agencies	Vancouver, CANADAKeelung, TAIWANVancouver, CANADAKeelung, TAIWAN	3	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0302-9743		978-3-642-24499-5	WOS:000306728900024		B	Gao Lan; Li Yi						Kuek, M; Shi, F; Zhao, RM		Measurements on Carbon Sink Benefits of Coastal Shelterbelt and the Interference Analysis in Guangdong Province of China								PROCEEDINGS OF 2011 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM - LOW-CARBON ECONOMICS AND SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY MANAGEMENT								51	58						2011	2011	Through the econometric studying on carbon sink benefits, the result show that the Coastal Shelterbelt System in Guangdong plays an active role in the carbon fixation and climate change mitigation, which is important to the development of low carbon economy in Guangdong Province. However, a variety of factors from natural environment and human activities will affect performance of the carbon sink about Coastal Shelterbelt; as a result, it is difficult to reach the its ideal level of effectiveness. This paper examines the route of interference factors acting on the carbon sink of Coastal Shelterbelt, and provides ideas and methods for regional ecological construction and sustainable development.

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is supporting a programme of four commercial scale demonstration plants that will capture carbon dioxide from power stations and transport it to underground geological storage facilities located offshore. If the demonstrations are successful, the Government is expecting the wider deployment of CCS from 2020 onwards.The Environment Agency (EA) regulates the operation of fossil fuel power stations in England and Wales under the Environmental Permitting Regulations. It will issue permits for the operation of CCS equipment at power stations to ensure the protection of the environment and gather data on the performance of CCS technology.The Environment Agency has produced a qualitative environmental risk assessment (ERA) for CCS that provides a high level screening of the key regulatory issues that fall within its remit. It uses a classic source! pathway! receptor model, screens and ranks the risks as high/medium/low/very low and describes how the risks will be reduced to an acceptable level. These risk management measures will form the basis of the EA's action plan for regulating CCS technology up to 2020. In addition to this high level generic ERA, each operator wanting to install CCS technology at a power station will have to carry out a detailed site-specific ERA as part of their application for an environmental permit.The EA has published the ERA on its website to inform the public debate on CCS and demonstrate openness and transparency in its work as an environmental regulator.					22nd Hazards Symposium - Process Safety and Environmental Protection22nd Hazards Symposium - Process Safety and Environmental Protection	APR 11-14, 2011APR 11-14, 2011	Inst Chem Engineers (N W Branch)Inst Chem Engineers (N W Branch)	Liverpool, ENGLANDLiverpool, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0374-1753		978-0-85295-547-5	WOS:000305323700001		J	Houghton, Adele								HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS A Tool for Designing Climate Change Resilience into Green Building and Planning Projects								JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING				6	2			66	87		10.3992/jgb.6.2.66				2011	2011	Historical records have documented considerable changes to the global climate, with significant health, economic, and environmental consequences. Climate projections predict more intense hurricanes; increased sea level rise; and more frequent and more intense natural disasters such as heat waves, heavy rainfall, and drought in the future (1; 2). The coast along the Gulf of Mexico is particularly vulnerable to many of these environmental hazards and at particular risk when several strike simultaneously-such as a hurricane disrupting electricity transmission during a heat wave.Due to its significant contribution to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the building sector already plays an important role in climate change mitigation efforts (e. g., reducing emissions). For example, voluntary programs such as the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Rating System (3), the Architecture 2030 Challenge (4), the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (5), and the Clinton Climate Initiative (6) focus almost exclusively on reducing energy consumption and increasing renewable energy generation. Mandatory regulations such as the International Energy Conservation Code (7), the International Green Building Code (8), and CalGreen (9) also emphasize GHG emission reduction targets.This leadership role is necessary. After all, the United States EPA estimates that the building sector accounts for 62.7% of total annual GHG emissions in the U. S., when the construction sector, facility operations, and transportation are factored in. In fact, the construction sector alone is the third largest industrial emitter of GHGs after the oil and gas and chemical industries, contributing 1.7% of total annual emissions (10; 11).As significant as these contributions appear, the built environment's true contribution to climate change is much larger than the GHG emissions attributed to building construction and operations. It is also a major determinant of which populations are vulnerable to climate change-related hazards, such as heat waves and flooding (12; 13). Architecture and land use planning can therefore be used as tools for building community resilience to the climate-related environmental changes underway (13).Climate change regulations and voluntary programs have begun to incorporate requirements targeting the built environment's ability to work in tandem with the natural environment to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect its occupants from the health consequences of a changing climate. For example, 11 states have incorporated climate change adaptation goals into their climate action plans (14). In 2010, the not-for-profit organization ICLEI: Local Governments for Sustainability launched a climate change adaptation program (15) to complement their existing mitigation program, which supports municipalities who have signed the U. S. Conference of Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement (16).New tools have been introduced to measure community vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. One of these tools, Health Impact Assessments (or HIAs), has emerged over the past decade as a powerful methodology to provide evidence-based recommendations to decision makers and community planning officials about the likely health co-benefits and co-harms associated with proposed policies and land use development proposals (17). While HIAs are becoming a more common feature of community planning efforts, this paper introduces them as an approach to designing climate change resilience into specific building projects.HIAs have been used in Europe and other parts of the world for decades to provide a science-based, balanced assessment of the risks and benefits to health associated with a proposed policy or program (18). In the U. S., they have been used over the past decade to evaluate transit-oriented developments, urban infill projects, and California's cap-and-trade legislation, among other topics (17; 19). To date, HIAs have been used mainly to inform large-scale community planning, land use, industrial, and policy decisions. However, the recommendations generated through the HIA process often bring to light previously unforeseen vulnerabilities, whether due to existing infrastructure, building technology, or socio-economic conditions.Designers can make use of the HIA process and its resulting recommendations to prioritize design/retrofit interventions that will result in the largest co-benefits to building owners, the surrounding community, and the environment. An HIA focused on the health impacts of climate change will likely generate recommendations that could enhance the longevity of a building project's useful life; protect its property value by contributing to the resilience of the surrounding community; and result in design decisions that prioritize strategies that maximize both short-term efficiencies and long-term environmental, economic, and social value.									3	0	0	0	0	3	2	137	1552-6100			WOS:000297056200006		J	van den Berg, Rob D.; Todd, David								The full road to impact: the experience of the Global Environment Facility Fourth Overall Performance Study								JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS				3	3			389	413		10.1080/19439342.2011.562302				2011	2011	The Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has developed an approach to impact evaluation that aims to go beyond causalities and counterfactuals into replication, up-scaling and longer-term lasting systemic changes. Starting from the OECD Development Assistance Committee glossary definition of impact and building on a theory-based approach to evaluation, several methods and tools have been developed that cover various aspects of the long road from outcomes to impact. This article presents both the development over time of these methods and tools and methodological considerations. Two full-scale impact evaluations were undertaken: the first on protected areas in Eastern Africa and the second on the GEF portfolio of projects supporting the removal from production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in countries with economies in transition. In addition several other impact studies were undertaken. The evaluations of various aspects of the progress from outcome to impact were gathered and as far as possible aggregated in the Fourth Overall Performance Study of the GEF, which was presented in 2009 to the replenishment process of the GEF. An overview is presented of progress toward impact of the GEF portfolio of finished projects on climate change mitigation and on stemming the loss of biodiversity. The Office will continue to develop and use the variety of impact evaluation tools at its disposal.									3	0	0	0	0	3	1	3	1943-9342			WOS:000297213800004		J	Mair, Judith				Mair, Judith/P-2273-2014	Mair, Judith/0000-0002-2447-3377			Exploring air travellers' voluntary carbon-offsetting behaviour								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				19	2			215	230	PII 927304248	10.1080/09669582.2010.517317				2011	2011	This paper advances understanding of consumers who purchase voluntary carbon offsets (VCOs) for flights by profiling the socio-demographic characteristics of VCO purchasers in Australia and the UK and investigating their environmental attitudes and beliefs. Earlier research shows that there is confusion and lack of clarity around VCO schemes, yet small numbers of consumers continue to purchase them. Using an online panel survey of 502 respondents, this research considers whether those who purchase VCOs can be considered to be ecocentric, and whether they share a similar socio-demographic profile with those engaging in other forms of pro-environmental behaviour. The results suggest three groups: oEcocentricso (36%), oMiddle of the Roado (31%) and oAnthropocentricso (33%). While VCO purchasers appear to be ecocentric, not all ecocentric respondents purchased VCOs and, additionally, those who did purchase, appear to have a different socio-demographic profile from others engaging in pro-environmental behaviour. The study suggests that this segment of the flying public, already willing to contribute towards climate change mitigation, may be the best segment to target with behavioural change messages intended to encourage the structural changes in travel choices required to mitigate climate change. Earlier suggestions that older females are more likely to purchase VCOs are not supported.									85	1	0	5	0	86	3	34	0966-9582			WOS:000287031700005		S	Sentjens, Jos; Deakin, Ian; Goudappel, Edwin						Gale, J; Hendriks, C; Turkenberg, W		Greenhouse Gas Masterplan and Risk Management								10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES		Energy Procedia		4				2028	2034		10.1016/j.egypro.2011.02.084				2011	2011	EU ETS industries operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty, complicated by the looming changes that will be required to comply with greenhouse gas reduction directives. Any plan to address these changes must incorporate a thorough analysis of the options and of the associated risks.Several risk and options analysis techniques are outlined and, while not widely established, can provide added confidence when preparing a strategy and may enable better management of the risks. An example Quantitative Risk Analysis (QDA) is provided which demonstrates its strength in collapsing a multi-dimensional risk analysis into an easy-to-interpret 2-dimension graph showing the likelihood of the economic viability, by utilisation of statistics and inter-dependencies.These techniques, such as QRA, have helped several refining and power companies to enhance their strategic planning process and to make investment decisions that are adequately hedged against the project risks.

This paper discusses several ways how CCS in the Dutch power sector can be stimulated after the round of demonstration activities up to 2015. It describes recent policy developments in the UK, US and Germany, and concludes that a policy package could be the most useful way forward if it includes a financial incentive to cover additional costs of CCS. The costs of financial support could amount to 1-3% of the Dutch electricity bill, even with CO2 prices in the (sic)20-50 range until 2030. A policy package could also include a regulatory instrument like an emissions performance standard (EPS) or other regulation for new coal-fired power plants to provide additional certainty. The EU Treaty explicitly leaves room for more stringent regulation from Member States required to protect the environment.

Industry CO2 emissions reduction is the key point for global climate change mitigation. The authors in this paper introduce a new concept of industry CO2 emissions efficiency and relatively design an industry CO2 emissions coefficient to measure it. With a sample analysis of Chongqing China, the authors find that 11 of 18 sectors of Chongqing industry have their great potentials of industry CO2 emissions reduction comparing to those of China's national level in sample year of 2007.

The recent global exponential growth in transport is unsustainable and must end unless the transport sector can decarbonize. The paper examines solutions for low-carbon transport systems; the behavioral options; possible demand reduction; the role of innovative technologies; and the means by which international agreements on pricing, standards, and regulations can be effectively used. Transport brings enormous benefits to society, and it has been instrumental in the globalization of the world economy, with substantial capital investments in its material infrastructure. Transport governance also needs rethinking to understand the major challenges, to implement major policy changes, and to address the problems of fragmented decision making. Holistic approaches, using ideas from transition management and niche development, are proposed as a framework within which both technological innovation and new patterns of travel and trade can be brought about.									62	0	0	0	0	62	11	91	1543-5938		978-0-8243-2336-3	WOS:000299610900010		J	Luetzkendorf, Thomas; Fan, Wei; Lorenz, David								Engaging financial stakeholders: opportunities for a sustainable built environment								BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION				39	5	SI		483	503		10.1080/09613218.2011.597206				2011	2011	The built environment is not exclusively influenced and shaped by the traditional supply-side and governmental (local and central) authorities. The financial sector has a significant influence on the built environment during the planning, construction, management and refurbishment stages. In particular, it exercises considerable influence on the realization of sustainable development principles in relation to an array of issues: climate change (mitigation and adaptation), energy efficiency, the closing of material cycles, and design and urban development quality. The major actors among financial stakeholders are differentiated and their various roles, interests, motives and options for influencing property and construction markets are analysed. The drivers are identified for increasing financial stakeholders' motivations and actions as positive agents for sustainable development in the built environment. The focus is on specific policy documents, instruments, products and mechanisms along with the supporting data, methods and decision-making processes.									20	0	0	0	0	20	2	16	0961-3218	1466-4321		WOS:000299274900006		J	Urban, Frauke; Mitchell, Tom; Villanueva, Paula Silva				Ahluwalia, Tarun/A-2762-2012	Urban, Frauke/0000-0003-3021-0220			Issues at the interface of disaster risk management and low-carbon development								CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT				3	3			259	279		10.1080/17565529.2011.598369				2011	2011	Effectively managing disaster risks is a critical tool for adapting to the impacts of climate change. However, climate change mitigation and low-carbon development have often been overlooked in disaster risk management (DRM) research, policy and practice. This article explores the links between DRM and low-carbon development and thereby sheds light on a new and emerging research and development agenda. Taking carbon considerations into account for DRM and post-disaster reconstruction can contribute to laying the foundations for low-carbon development and the benefits it can bring. It can also provide an opportunity to combine adaptation and mitigation efforts. The article elaborates the carbon implications of DRM interventions and post-disaster reconstruction practices, drawing on case studies from flood risk reduction, coastal protection, drought risk reduction, post-disaster housing and energy supply reconstruction. Finally, the article makes suggestions about how the carbon implications of DRM measures could be accounted for in a coherent manner. Suggestions include calculating the carbon emissions from DRM and post-disaster interventions as part of globally standardized environmental impact assessments and improving the linkages between ministries of environment, energy and climate, and those ministries that deal with disasters.									6	0	0	0	0	6	0	16	1756-5529			WOS:000294992600006		S	Baba, Alper					BABA, ALPER/0000-0001-5307-3156	Baba, A; Gunduz, O; Friedel, MJ; Tayfur, G; Howard, KWF; Chambel, A		Climate Change Mitigation with Renewable Energy: Geothermal								CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECTS ON WATER RESOURCES: ISSUES OF NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SECURITY		NATO Science for Peace and Security Series C-Environmental Security						25	33		10.1007/978-94-007-1143-3_4				2011	2011	On a global scale, there is increasing evidence that climate is changing and of a discernible human influence. Many of scientists are confident that if current emissions of greenhouse gases continue, the world will be warmer, sea levels will rise and regional climate patterns will change. According to some scientist, global temperatures are expected to rise faster over the next century than over any time during the last 10,000 years. From this token, geothermal energy is now considered to be one of the most important alternative energy sources to minimize climate change. Geothermal technologies for power generation or direct use operate with little or no greenhouse gas emissions. Geothermal energy is generally accepted as being an environmentally-friendly energy source, particularly when compared to fossil fuel energy sources. Geothermal resources have long been used for direct heat extraction for district urban heating, industrial processing, domestic water and space heating, leisure and balneotherapy applications. Geothermal energy is used in more than 80 countries for direct heat application and 24 countries for power generation. Re-injection of fluids maintains a constant pressure in the reservoir, thus increasing the field's life and reducing concerns about environmental impacts. Geothermal energy has several significant characteristics that make it suitable for climate change mitigation.

Development failed to trickle down and energy poverty remains a significant issue in Asia. While it is important to amend the current emission trajectory and, at the same time, address issues about energy access, a colossal need to mobilize funding is necessary a gap which multilateral development banks are expected to fill. This article explores and assesses the important role the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has in addressing these issues. Drawing on the assessment of ADB Country Strategies and the energy sector portfolio in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam, the enquiry reveals, among other things, that only 42% of ADB energy financed projects contain renewable components, and that data on how ADB projects addressed on the issue of energy poverty remains unavailable. On top of the quantitative data presented, this article also presents a critical engagement of ADB's policy environmental assumptions.					2nd Worlds Oline Climate Change Conference (Climate 2009)2nd Worlds Oline Climate Change Conference (Climate 2009)	NOV 02-06, 2009NOV 02-06, 2009		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	12	1610-2010		978-3-642-14775-3	WOS:000298933100004		S	Piana, Valentino						Filho, WL		Exploring Economic and Political Drivers for the Introduction of Innovative Mitigation Policies								ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ELEMENTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE		Climate Change Management						405	424		10.1007/978-3-642-14776-0_26				2011	2011	Politicians and high-level officials from all over the world will meet in Copenhagen in December 2009 to reach a global agreement on climate. Mitigation policies aiming at radical cuts in emissions, starting now, deepening over time, and widening their geopolitical coverage, will require domestic and international consensus, if they are to be agreed and implemented in the months and years to come.The paper explores the drivers for adoption of mitigation policies, with a special emphasis on those arising from the International Symposium on Innovative Economic Policies for Climate Change Mitigation, held in July 2009 at the Subiaco Monastery of St Scholastica (Italy).Instead of framing climate change mitigation as a burden, these policies are meant to generate a conducive environment for innovation, profits, employment, wages, and improvement of real quality of life.An exploration of their economic and environmental effectiveness is conducted, together with a limited analysis of possible political factors influencing the decision to adopt them.

Policy proposals for an enabling environment have emerged from the voluntary actors, highlighting the need for a framework to spur adoption of carbon-friendly ICT practices. By exploring the links between ICT and climate change, this paper intends to highlight the policy gaps that exist to enable a wider use of ICT for climate change solutions. The study explores the potentials of climate change mainstreaming into global ICT policy platforms at the ITU, as it moves towards a framework regarding ICTs and climate change. A combination of supply and demand side policy analysis identified the forces that present both risk and opportunity for ITU to become a more meaningful player in this context. It was identified that ITU can enable greater coherence and catalysis among stakeholders and policy areas given the potentials across climate change mitigation, monitoring, and adaptation.					2nd Worlds Online Climate Change Conference (Climate 2009)2nd Worlds Online Climate Change Conference (Climate 2009)	NOV 02-06, 2009NOV 02-06, 2009		ELECTR NETWORKELECTR NETWORK	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1610-2010		978-3-642-14775-3	WOS:000298933100028		J	Kopytko, Natalie; Perkins, John					Kopytko, Natalie/0000-0002-5164-1233			Climate change, nuclear power, and the adaptation-mitigation dilemma								ENERGY POLICY				39	1			318	333		10.1016/j.enpol.2010.09.046				JAN 2011	2011	Many policy-makers view nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, however, interact with existing and new nuclear power plants, and these installations must contend with dilemmas between adaptation and mitigation. This paper develops five criteria to assess the adaptation-mitigation dilemma on two major points: (1) the ability of nuclear power to adapt to climate change and (2) the potential for nuclear power operation to hinder climate change adaptation. Sea level rise models for nine coastal sites in the United States, a review of US Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, and reports from France's nuclear regulatory agency provided insights into issues that have arisen from sea level rise, shoreline erosion, coastal storms, floods, and heat waves. Applying the criteria to inland and coastal nuclear power plants reveals several weaknesses. Safety stands out as the primary concern at coastal locations, while inland locations encounter greater problems with interrupted operation. Adapting nuclear power to climate change entails either increased expenses for construction and operation or incurs significant costs to the environment and public health and welfare. Mere absence of greenhouse gas emissions is not sufficient to assess nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Second, the climate change mitigation potential is thought to be relatively high in the tourism sector because efforts to lower energy consumption greenhouse gas(GHG) emission in the sector. Third, this study analyzed case study including a penguin festival in philip Island penguin Reserve, Victoria in Australia.Forth, Hwacheon DMZ(Demilitarized zone) area should be designated as a green tourism reserve and a part of sustainable tourism development. Also, programatic operationalizing green tourism, with in the nature biosphere reserves and tour areas, should coincide with the tour objectives of green tourism.Fifth, the method of green tourism management have to establish promotional action plan for green business management and EcoÂ·label for tourist accommodations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1598-7760			KJD:ART001633593		J	Heo, Eunnyeong								Global Energy Environment Change and Issues in Korea's Future Energy Mix			국내외 에너지환경 변화와 우리나라 에너지 믹스 전략 수립과정에의 시사점					Korea Energy Economic Review	에너지경제연구			10	2			187	205						2011	2011	Energy mix can be considered as a result from various selections in energy markets and also as an output of government energy policies. In this paper, we examine recent changes in global energy environment and discuss possible changes in Korea's energy mix and energy mix strategies and plans toward a better energy future in Korea. As energy mix issue is rather political instead of academic, this paper focuses more on policy implications. Since most of the energy supply sectors have been under the government control in Korea, and as most of the supply options were central government-invested big generation facilities and infrastructures, setting the energy mix in Korea is considered as setting the supply options by the central government.However, distributed resources such as renewable energy and small reactor and small gas turbine changes this situation toward to consumers. Technology options suggested by climate change mitigation policy should be included in the energy mix strategy. And high fossil fuel price and suggestions of possible connections with Russia and North Korea asks us to focus more on inter-regional connections into Korea's energy mix. This paper suggests two focal points to be included in the future process of energy mix strategy; to diversify objectives of energy mix strategy, and to move toward distributed, regional and technology- oriented energy mix strategies.				한 나라의 에너지 믹스는 소비자 선택의 결과물이자 동시에 국가 정책의 산물이기도 하다. 21세기 들어 나타나는 국내외 환경변화는 우리나라가 지향해 오던 기존의 에너지믹스의 방향에 새로운 고려사항이 발생하였음을 의미한다. 본 고에서는 국내외 에너지 분야 환경변화의 중심 내용들을 살펴보고, 이들 변화들이 우리나라 에너지믹스 정책 수립과정에서 새로운 변화를 추구하여야 할 부분에 대하여 논하여 본다. 에너지믹스가 학술적인 주제이기보다는 정책적인 주제이기에 학술적 분석보다는 국내외적 변화가 우리나라 에너지정책 수립과정에 미칠 정책적 시사점의 도출에 중점을 두었다. 에너지 믹스에 영향을 줄 것으로 예상되는 변화로 기후변화와 이로 인한 신재생에너지의 에너지믹스 포함 문제와 원자력에너지에 대한 의사결정, 수송용 에너지에서 나타나는 기술에너지 특성의 고려, 에너지산업의 수출산업화, 해외자원개발 및 러시아-북한과의 천연가스 파이프라인 건설을 포함한 지역간 에너지연결 등 에너지망의 확대를 들었다.  본 고에서는 에너지 믹스 전략 수립에서의 주요 전략 변화방향으로 에너지 믹스 설정의 목적함수를 다양화 할 것과 분산형, 지역형, 기술형 에너지 계획을 추진할 것을 제안한다.					1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1599-7057			KJD:ART001594900		J	박덕영								The Environmental Protection System in the Treaty on the  Functioning of the European Union  -Focused on Environment Related Trade Provisions			EU기능조약상의 환경보호체계에 관한 고찰 －환경 관련 통상조항을 중심으로 -					Korean Forum on International Trade and Business Law	국제거래법연구			20	1			241	258						2011	2011	The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force December 1 of 2009, is the impetus for change in the EU system. Thanks to the treaty, the EU now has legal personality and can officially take part in the global affairs using its own name.Also the treaty amended most of the TEU and renamed the Treaty establishing the European Community to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Since the 1990s, global concern over the environment is growing and countries all over the world are doing their best to implement the mandatory reduction of greenhouse gases of the Kyoto Protocol. Bearing this trend in mind, the EU has diligently focused on preserving the environment by imposing various conservation measures and now is regarded by the international community as a model case in environmental protection and greenhouse gas reduction. But the probability of these EU measures acting as potential trade barriers against countries wanting to export to the EU is very high. As a result, the study over trade related environmental regulations of the EU is thriving in Korea. But even though an understanding of these regulations must be grounded on a basic knowledge of the provisions on environment and trade in the Treaty on the functioning of the EU, it is difficult to find such research. In other words, much of the scholarship is concentrated on specialized research supported by the industry and related organizations, while analysis on the provisions which are the prerequisites for such research is rare.This paper first reviews article 3 of the TEU, which declares the environment protection principle and is the fundamental clause on environment preservation inside the EU; articles 191-193, which constitutes part 20 of the TFEU and specifies the above principles; article 114, which stipulates the harmonization of domestic laws of EU member states; and other clauses directly regulating issues on the environment and their interrelation. Then it will touch upon articles 34 and 35, the key provisions on import and export quotas, and analyze, inter alia, how to interpret the exceptional clause of article 36 and what the current environmental trend of its interpretation is. Finally, this paper examines ‘rule of reason’ which has been developing through the ECJ rulings for the protection of environment.Expectations of an increase in trade with the EU are high after concluding the negotiation of the Korea-EU FTA in July 2009, but these hopes might be dashed because of the EU’s trade measures targeted on protecting the environment. These trade measures are based on various regulations or directives which are grounded on environment related provisions of the EU treaties. Without an accurate understanding of these undertakings, the strategies Korean export firms can use when entering into the EU market are bound to be limited. Furthermore,considering the possibility of Korean small businesses abandoning export plans due to a lack of understanding on these barriers, the Korean government should provide a comprehensive program to lend aid to these small businesses. Also,Korea should actively adopt promising EU environmental measures to prepare beforehand for the ‘Age of Global Warming’.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1229-3822			KJD:ART001574526		J	Nakakaawa, Charlotte Anne; Vedeld, Paul O.; Aune, Jens B.								Spatial and temporal land use and carbon stock changes in Uganda: implications for a future REDD strategy								MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE				16	1			25	62		10.1007/s11027-010-9251-0				JAN 2011	2011	Using a map overlay procedure in a Geographical Information System environment, we quantify and map major land use and land cover (LULC) change patterns in Uganda period 1990-2005 and determine whether the transitions were random or systematic. The analysis reveals that the most dominant systematic land use change processes were deforestation (woodland to subsistence farmland-3.32%); forest degradation (woodland to bushland (4.01%) and grassland (4.08%) and bush/grassland conversion to cropland (5.5%) all resulting in a net reduction in forests (6.1%). Applying an inductive approach based on logistic regression and trend analyses of observed changes we analyzed key drivers of LULC change. Significant predictors of forest land use change included protection status, market access, poverty, slope, soil quality and presence/absence of a stream network. Market access, poverty and population all decreased the log odds of retaining forests. In addition, poverty also increased the likelihood of degradation. An increase in slope decreased the likelihood of deforestation. Using the stock change and gain/loss approaches we estimated the change in forest carbon stocks and emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Results indicate a negligible increase in forest carbon stocks (3,260 t C yr-1) in the period 1990-2005 when compared to the emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation (2.67 million t C yr-1). In light of the dominant forest land use change patterns, the drivers and change in carbon stocks, we discuss options which could be pursued to implement a future national REDD plus strategy which considers livelihood, biodiversity and climate change mitigation objectives.									19	2	0	4	0	19	0	45	1381-2386			WOS:000285108900002		J	de Paula Gomes, Marcos Sebastiao; Muylaert de Araujo, Maria Silvia								Artificial cooling of the atmosphere-A discussion on the environmental effects								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				15	1			780	786		10.1016/j.rser.2010.07.045				JAN 2011	2011	This article presents a literature review to discuss some new technological options for climate change mitigation called as Geoengineering and the environmental impacts related to aerosol emissions. Some proposals to produce a cooler effect in the Earth surface at short term are defending the injection of a large quantity of aerosol particles in the stratosphere like a "virtual Pinatubo". In 15 June 1991 a volcanic eruption of the Pinatubo Mount in Philippines resulted in around -0.5 degrees C variation in Earth surface temperature in 1992 and only in 1995 the temperature returned back to the former one. Several important environmental issues arise from this kind of mitigation proposal. Some of the topics which may be considered relevant in such analysis are: the level of acceptable risk of this kind of technological option for the human and the environment as a whole; the foreseen linear and non-linear impacts resultant from the artificial cooling effect in the Earth surface; the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this kind of proposals. The environmental problems associated to aerosols injections into the stratosphere are the main topic discussed in the present article. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon labelling schemes have been introduced in many countries, including South Korea, to address climate change. By analysing the product's life-cycle, carbon labelling tries to ensure that the products are environment friendly and harmless for the consumers. Carbon labelling, which provides information about a product’s carbon footprint and has the potential to facilitate consumer participation in climate change mitigation, can have a significant effect on consumer preferences. And the change in consumer preferences will eventually affect the trade flows among trading partners.Currently there are no WTO rules specific to climate change. However, the WTO is relevant because carbon labelling schemes are likely to present some concerns by hampering international trade flows from an international trade perspective. As carbon labelling schemes relate to trade, these measures may be subject to WTO rules and procedures. Carbon labelling schemes are likely to come under the TBT Agreement which covers technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures. The main question is whether technical regulations or standards on NPR PPMs falls within the purview of the agreement. Despite the lack of consensus, only the product-related PPMs are considered to be covered by the TBT Agreement. The question of whether or not the application of carbon labels to products provides them with any commercial advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace, and whether the discrimination of products on the basis of embodied carbon is permissible in the WTO jurisprudence are also raised in the context of carbon labelling in the WTO. Recent proliferation of private carbon labelling schemes also raises the question of whether the TBT Agreement is applicable to private carbon labelling. It is generally understood that most private carbon labelling schemes fall outside the purview of the TBT Agreement. These private standards are likely to defeat the very purpose of the TBT Agreement as they are not guided by any regulations and can be trade-restrictive.It is expected that carbon labelling will continue to gain in significance, especially from the WTO perspective. Lack of international standardization and the multiplicity of carbon labelling standards not only cause confusion but also diminishes their effectiveness in influencing consumers' behaviors. Consequently, efforts are being made to standardize carbon labelling schemes at international level.				기후변화에 대한 세계적인 관심이 지속적으로 증가하면서 우리나라를 비롯하여 많은 국가들이 탄소라벨링제도를 도입해오고 있다. 탄소라벨링은 제품의 전 과정동안에 발생하는 이산화탄소 배출량으로 환산한 탄소발자국을 제품에 표시하는 제도로, 소비자에게 제품의 친환경성을 비교 선택하여 제품을 구매할 수 있도록 유도하고자 한다. 하지만 탄소라벨링은 다자간 무역체제에서 무역장벽이 될 수 있다는 잠재적인 가능성 때문에 WTO체제 내에서 논쟁의 대상이 된다.WTO체제 내 탄소라벨링과 관련하여 검토해 볼 필요가 있는 이슈는, 첫째, NPR PPMs에 대한 기술규정 또는 표준이 WTO협정의 규율범위에 포함되는가의 여부, 둘째, 탄소라벨의 부착으로 인한 제품 간의 차별 가능성과 환경친화적인 생산 및 공정과정의 여부에 따른 제품의 동종성 판단, 셋째, 비정부차원의 탄소라벨링이 WTO협정의 규율범위에 포함되는가의 여부이다. 이를 위해서는 기술규정, 표준, 그리고 기술규정과 표준에의 적합여부 판정절차를 다루는 WTO의 TBT협정을 중심으로 검토해볼 필요가 있다.NPR PPMs에 대한 기술규정 또는 표준이 TBT협정의 규율대상인가에 대해서는 아직까지 국가들 간 컨센서스가 없는 것으로 보이지만, 제품과 관련된 PPMs만이 TBT협정의 적용을 받는다고 보는 것이 WTO 회원국들의 일반적인 해석이라고 보인다. 환경친화적 PPMs의 여부에 따른 제품의 구분과 관련, 환경친화적인 움직임을 수용하려는 WTO의 현 입장을 고려했을 때, 제품의 동종성 판단을 위해 환경친화적 PPMs 요소를 고려할 수 있을 것으로 판단된다. 비정부차원의 탄소라벨링과 관련, 대부분은 TBT협정의 규율범위에서 벗어나는 것으로 해석되고 있다. WTO의 규율을 받지 않는 비정부차원의 탄소라벨링 표준은 투명성이 부족하고 소비자에게 혼란을 주며 무역제한적으로 작용할 가능성이 많다는 점을 고려하여, WTO는 비정부차원의 탄소라벨링에 대한 규제 필요성을 인식하고 이에 대한 논의를 지속하고 있다.앞으로도 탄소라벨링에 대한 관심은 증대할 것으로 예상된다. 현재로서는 탄소라벨 관련 공통적인 국제기준이 존재하지 않는다. 하지만 이로 인하여 탄소라벨링이 다자간 무역체제에 무역장벽으로 작용할 수 있음을 인식하여, 현재 국제적으로 수용될 수 있는 탄소라벨링 관련 국제표준 개발이 활발히 진행되고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1226-2994			KJD:ART001626687		J	Maller, Cecily J.; Horne, Ralph E.

In the context of preparing for climate change, it can be argued that significant improvements to existing stock and changes to how it is inhabited are required to improve the environmental performance of residential dwellings. Yet home improvement, environmental performance and household practice rarely occur together in social enquiry. Drawing on Hobson's framing of the 'rationalisation discourse of sustainable consumption' we explore the assumed links between homeowners' concerns for the environment, home improvement consumption and household practice. Amongst other findings, we demonstrate that although there is some association amongst these elements, the links are weak. To achieve real change towards climate change mitigation we suggest future policy and programs need to look beyond such simple causal links between attitudes and behaviour and draw on a deeper understanding of the social practices and associated systems of provision implicated in daily life.									32	0	0	0	0	32	0	7	0811-1146			WOS:000287484400005		J	Barker, Terry; Anger, Annela; Dessens, Olivier; Pollitt, Hector; Rogers, Helen; Scrieciu, Serban; Jones, Rod; Pyle, John				Scrieciu, S.

The paper covers the data and methods, changes in atmospheric gas concentrations, the macroeconomic effects of the policies, and the outcome for pollution. The results suggest that in the conditions of underemployment in Mexico, substantial investment in low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps and geo-thermal power, could improve employment prospects, maintain growth, as well as reduce some of the risks associated with prospective falls in oil revenues. The concentrations of low-level ozone, both for Mexico-only and global decarbonisation scenarios relative to the original reference case, show appreciable reductions, sufficient to bring concentrations close to the WHO guideline levels. An indication is given of the potential scale of the benefits on human health in Mexico City. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Even as a national mitigation agenda solidifies, researchers and political actors might strategically maintain local places and types of landscape center cities, older and newer suburbs, and rural areas in different United States regions as distinct spheres for analysis and action. This local articulation permits ongoing analysis of how place/landscape type-specific conditions structure everyday greenhouse gas emissions and the prospects for reducing them. As such, it promotes mitigation programs that encompass broad, long-term infrastructure and lifestyle transformations for energy efficiency and conservation; not only top-down changes to energy generation technologies. Participatory climate change mitigation research in the Philadelphia suburbs demonstrates how geographically particular metropolitan development patterns shape the prospects for two such policies, residential energy efficiency improvement and the promotion of local food systems. The sprawling suburb investigated here, with the center city its development has helped impoverish, challenges these mitigation options in particular and emissions reduction in general. Deeply problematic elements include both the landscape's ever-extending physical morphology and the socioeconomic inequalities that this built environment - and the stakeholders who build it - help to create and maintain. Reshaping this and other suburban landscapes can not only promote long-term climate change mitigation but also reduce vulnerability to climate change's unavoidable impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This assessment gives an overview of past, present and future emissions from land transport, of their impacts on the atmospheric composition and air quality, on human health and climate change and on options for mitigation.In the past vehicle exhaust emission control has successfully reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. This contributed to improved air quality and reduced health impacts in industrialised countries. In developing countries however, pollutant emissions have been growing strongly, adversely affecting many populations. In addition, ozone and particulate matter change the radiative balance and hence contribute to global warming on shorter time scales. Latest knowledge on the magnitude of land transport's impact on global warming is reviewed here.In the future, road transport's emissions of these pollutants are expected to stagnate and then decrease globally. This will then help to improve the air quality notably in developing countries. On the contrary, emissions of carbon dioxide and of halocarbons from mobile air conditioners have been globally increasing and are further expected to grow. Consequently, road transport's impact on climate is gaining in importance. The expected efficiency improvements of vehicles and the introduction of biofuels will not be sufficient to offset the expected strong growth in both, passenger and freight transportation. Technical measures could offer a significant reduction potential, but strong interventions would be needed as markets do not initiate the necessary changes. Further reductions would need a resolute expansion of low-carbon fuels, a tripling of vehicle fuel efficiency and a stagnation in absolute transport volumes. Land transport will remain a key sector in climate change mitigation during the next decades. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

It is difficult to assess whether this will happen or not, but it is possible to make an assessment of a future situation.This article presents two analyses with one objective: to determine if biofuels might become competitive in the future. The first analysis examines the dependencies of two quotations which have a strong relationship with fuels: the crude oil quotation and the CO2 bond quotation. The analysis of these relationships may help to forecast the future competitiveness of biofuels. For instance, biofuels' future competitiveness will be higher if their raw material costs are not related to crude oil quotations or if they are related in a negative way (the higher the crude oil quotations the lower the raw material biofuels' cost). The second analysis focuses on the market penetration of biofuels in the Spanish market. There are data related to biofuels monthly consumption in Spain since 2007 and it is possible to know if biofuels are gaining market quota since then. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate-change mitigation policies will alter the decision-making environment for land management, and changes in agricultural productivity will influence cultivated land expansion. We explore to what extent future increases in agricultural productivity might offset conversion of tropical forest lands to crop lands under a climate mitigation policy and a contrasting no-policy scenario in a global integrated assessment model. The Global Change Assessment Model is applied here to simulate a mitigation policy that stabilizes radiative forcing at 4.5 Wm(-2) ( approximately 526 ppm CO(2)) in the year 2100 by introducing a price for all greenhouse gas emissions, including those from land use. These scenarios are simulated with several cases of future agricultural productivity growth rates and the results downscaled to produce gridded maps of potential land-use change. We find that tropical forests are preserved near their present-day extent, and bioenergy crops emerge as an effective mitigation option, only in cases in which a climate mitigation policy that includes an economic price for land-use emissions is in place, and in which agricultural productivity growth continues throughout the century. We find that idealized land-use emissions price assumptions are most effective at limiting deforestation, even when cropland area must increase to meet future food demand. These findings emphasize the importance of accounting for feedbacks from land-use change emissions in global climate change mitigation strategies.									56	0	0	19	0	56	0	35	0027-8424			WOS:000284261800010	20921413	J	Fernando, Ana L.; Duarte, Maria P.; Almeida, Joana; Boleo, Sara; Mendes, Benilde				Almeida, Joana/A-7182-2011; Fernando, Ana Luisa/I-2796-2012; Mendes, Benilde/D-3265-2018	Almeida, Joana/0000-0001-8669-1970; Fernando, Ana Luisa/0000-0001-9270-3982; Mendes, Benilde/0000-0001-7029-2553; Duarte, Maria Paula/0000-0002-8699-0070			Environmental impact assessment of energy crops cultivation in Europe								BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR				4	6			594	604		10.1002/bbb.249				NOV-DEC 2010	2010	The production of energy crops must be studied and evaluated in terms of environmental impact, in order to integrate them into a sustainable agricultural development. As bioenergy carriers they offer ecological advantages over fossil fuels by contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases and acidifying emissions. However, there could be ecological shortcomings related to the intensity of agricultural production. There is a risk of polluting water and air, losing soil quality, enhancing erosion, and reducing biodiversity. In the scope of the project Future Crops for Food, Feed, Fiber and Fuel (4F Crops), supported by the European Union, an environmental impact assessment study was developed and applied to the production of potential energy crops in Europe. The following variables were selected as categories: use of water and mineral resources, soil quality and erosion, emission of minerals and pesticides to soil and water, waste generation and utilization, landscape, and biodiversity. In addition, a normalization and weighting procedure was applied, which attempts to aggregate environmental impacts. Results suggest that growing energy crops does not inflict higher impact on the environment compared to potato and wheat farming (regarding the studied categories). Although the different indicators did not yield a common pattern, overall results suggest that woody and lignocellulosic crops have an advantage over annual crop systems, namely regarding erodibility and biodiversity. Some crop management options, such as pesticides and fertilizers inputs, can influence the outcomes. However, site-specific factors should be accurately assessed to evaluate the adequacy between crop and location. Environmental hotspots in the systems are detected and options for improvement are presented.

However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning.									177	11	0	78	3	194	16	335	0960-3115	1572-9710		WOS:000282870700013		J	Spence, Alexa; Poortinga, Wouter; Pidgeon, Nick; Lorenzoni, Irene				Spence, Alexa/D-3646-2009; Poortinga, Wouter/A-1802-2010	Spence, Alexa/0000-0003-4014-0430; Poortinga, Wouter/0000-0002-6926-8545			PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF ENERGY CHOICES: THE INFLUENCE OF BELIEFS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT				21	5			385	407		10.1260/0958-305X.21.5.385				SEP 2010	2010	Past research has documented high levels of public concern for risks relating to nuclear power, with opposition to nuclear energy particularly being linked with general environmental concern. However recent UK energy policy, and other debates worldwide, has led to a repositioning of nuclear power as a 'low carbon' electricity source with potential benefits for mitigating climate change. Whilst many previous studies have examined perceptions of climate change and nuclear energy separately, this large British public attitude survey explores relationships between the two as well as with perceptions of other energy sources. Both general environmental concern and concerns about climate change were linked with positive evaluations of renewables and negative evaluations of nuclear power. We conclude that, despite the policy positioning of nuclear power as a low carbon electricity source, most people concerned about climate change continue to perceive nuclear negatively, something partially explained by general environmental concerns.									42	0	0	1	0	42	1	46	0958-305X			WOS:000290306000003		J	Alcolea, A.; Ibarra, I.; Caparros, A.; Rodriguez, R.

That response is examined by means of a particular efflorescence taken from an acid mine drainage environment. This mixture of weathered products is mainly composed by secondary sulfate minerals, which are formed in evaporation conditions, appearing as efflorescence salts. Thermogravimetry coupled to mass spectrometry has been used to analyze the three main loss steps that happen when this combination of minerals is heated from 30 to 1,100 A degrees C. This inorganic material is based on a mixture of hexahydrite, zinc sulfate hexahydrate, apjonite, gypsum, plumbojarosite, calcite, quartz, and magnetite. While heating, three main effluent gases evolved from this efflorescence. At a standard heating rate of 10 A degrees C/min, loss of water (dehydration) occurred over 30-500 A degrees C in four major steps, loss of carbon dioxide (decarbonisation) occurred over 200-800 A degrees C in three steps, and loss of sulfur trioxide (desulfation) occurred over 400-1,100 A degrees C in three steps. According to the results, thermal analysis is an excellent technique for the study of decomposition in these systems.									16	0	0	2	0	16	1	9	1388-6150			WOS:000281256500048		J	Miyanishi, Masayuki								Manufacturing of Light Weight Cars								STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				81	9	SI		1	8						SEP 2010	2010	Much industry developed with the development of civilization, and many people came to use cars all over the world. As for the development of the human, the balance is kept as far as natural environments enjoy it, but the balance is changed into global warming, depletion of the ozone layer. The improvement of the correspondence of technology to the global environment is an unavoidable situation these days. A high aim to "reduce the discharge of the whole world by 50% by 2050" in greenhouse gas reduction target in No. 15 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change contracting party meeting (popular name COP15) is raised. As for vehicle developing, it is necessary to act on the problem to reduce discharge of CO2 with better collision safety and better vehicle function using lightweight technology.

How the effects of economic development processes dictate environmental changes can be found through the study of EKC. To understand the EKC phenomena for climate change, this study was undertaken by reviewing the available literature. As CO2, SOx and NOx are the significant greenhouse gases (GHG) responsible for global warming, thus leading to climate change, the study focused on those GHGs for EKC consideration. With an understanding of the different EKC trajectories, an attempt was made to determine the implications for the economic development of Bangladesh in regards to the EKC. It was shown that EKC for CO2 was following a monotonous straight line in most cases. SOx were shown to follow the full trajectory of the EKC in most situations and NOx was shown the hope only for the developed countries getting the low-income turning point. The type of economic policy that Bangladesh should follow in regards to the discussed pollutants and sources is also revealed. From these discussions, contributions to policy stimulation in Bangladesh are likely to be made. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. Turkey's energy production meets nearly 28% of its total primary energy consumption. As would be expected, the rapid expansion of energy production and consumption has brought with it a wide range of environmental issues at the local, regional and global levels. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey presently has considerable renewable energy sources. The most important renewable sources are hydropower, biomass, geothermal, solar and wind. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Turkey has a great and ever-intensifying need for power and water supplies and they also have the greatest remaining hydro potential. Hydropower and especially small hydropower are emphasized as Turkey's renewable energy sources. Turkey's hydro electric potential can meet 33-46% of its electric energy demand in 2020 and this potential may easily and economically be developed. This paper presents a review of the potential and utilization of the renewable energy sources in Turkey. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to achieve this, a parallel algorithm had to be developed for the river routing part of the LPJ code. It can be shown that the run time of the parallel LPJ model scales well with the number of parallel tasks, even getting a super-linear speedup for 8-128 tasks. The sequential part of the model code can be estimated to be only 0.16%. This offers the opportunity, for example, to apply the model to find optimal climate change mitigation/adaptation paths requiring a multitude of subsequent simulation runs. The algorithm can also be used for networks with a different topology than river routing networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The best energy crops available in the Italian panorama are identified and the problem of maximizing the bioenergy production over an entire regional area is formulated. Each cultivar is thus assigned to the suitable land accounting for sensitive parameters that characterize it and taking into account current land use. The assumption made here is that marginal land and set-asides can be converted to energy crops without altering current practices and cash crops' production. The method is based on the integration of GIS data (spatially continuous) with data derived from the agricultural census (spatially discrete). We carry out the analysis for Emilia-Romagna, in Northern Italy. The sustainable growth of energy crops, with an optimized network of conversion facilities distributed in the territory, may significantly contribute to the local energy supply and to climate change mitigation.

This study investigates the distributional effects of climate change taxes on households belonging to different income and lifestyle groups; and it compares the effects of a CO2 tax with a multiple GHG tax in the UK in terms of cost efficiency and distributional effects.Results show that a multi GHG tax is more efficient than a CO2 tax due to lower marginal abatement costs, and that both taxes are regressive, with lower income households paying a relatively larger share of their income for the taxes than higher income households. A shift from a CO2 tax to a GHG tax will reduce and shift the tax burden between consumption categories such as from energy-intensive products to food products. Consumers have different abilities to respond to the tax and change their behavior due to their own socio-economic attributes as well as the physical environment such as the age of the housing stock, location, and the availability of infrastructure. The housing-related carbon emissions are the largest component of the CO2 tax payments for low income groups and arguments could be made for compensation of income losses and reduction of fuel poverty through further government intervention.									43	2	0	7	0	44	1	33	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000277499500007	20429551	J	Hoffmann, Irene								Climate change and the characterization, breeding and conservation of animal genetic resources								ANIMAL GENETICS				41				32	46		10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02043.x			1	MAY 2010	2010	P>Livestock production both contributes to and is affected by climate change. In addition to the physiological effects of higher temperatures on individual animals, the consequences of climate change are likely to include increased risk that geographically restricted rare breed populations will be badly affected by disturbances. Indirect effects may be felt via ecosystem changes that alter the distribution of animal diseases or affect the supply of feed. Breeding goals may have to be adjusted to account for higher temperatures, lower quality diets and greater disease challenge. Species and breeds that are well adapted to such conditions may become more widely used. Climate change mitigation strategies, in combination with ever increasing demand for food, may also have an impact on breed and species utilization, driving a shift towards monogastrics and breeds that are efficient converters of feed into meat, milk and eggs. This may lead to the neglect of the adaptation potential of local breeds in developing countries. Given the potential for significant future changes in production conditions and in the objectives of livestock production, it is essential that the value provided by animal genetic diversity is secured. This requires better characterization of breeds, production environments and associated knowledge; the compilation of more complete breed inventories; improved mechanisms to monitor and respond to threats to genetic diversity; more effective in situ and ex situ conservation measures; genetic improvement programmes targeting adaptive traits in high-output and performance traits in locally adapted breeds; increased support for developing countries in their management of animal genetic resources; and wider access to genetic resources and associated knowledge.									121	1	0	89	2	123	0	43	0268-9146			WOS:000276775100003	20500754	J	Pedersen Zari, Maibritt					Pedersen Zari, Maibritt/0000-0003-4664-7558			Biomimetic design for climate change adaptation and mitigation								ARCHITECTURAL SCIENCE REVIEW				53	2			172	183		10.3763/asre.2008.0065				MAY 2010	2010	This article examines biomimicry where organisms or ecosystems are mimicked in human design as a means to either mitigate the causes of climate change that the built environment is responsible for or adapt to the impacts of climate change Different biomimetic approaches to design are discussed and categorized, and a series of examples illustrate the benefits and drawbacks of each approach Biomimicry s potential role in addressing climate change in the built environment over the short, medium and long term is examined Specific principles of ecosystem biomimicry for architecture have been deduced through a comparative cross-disciplinary review and are presented It is posited that the incorporation of a thorough understanding of biology and ecology into architectural design will be significant in the creation of a built environment that contributes to the health of human communities, while increasing positive integration with natural carbon cycles									24	0	0	2	0	24	3	28	0003-8628	1758-9622		WOS:000284560600004		J	Friel, Sharon					Friel, Sharon/0000-0002-8345-5435			Climate change, food insecurity and chronic diseases: sustainable and healthy policy opportunities for Australia.

On one hand, carbon-free energy sources must play a role in climate change mitigation. On the other hand, renewables might help meet needs of rural people without access to modern energy services. However, if renewables are deployed to combat climate change (primarily resulting from emissions in the developed economies) then providing basic energy services in the developing world may be compromised. The tendency to conflate the two drivers by installing renewables in rural areas for carbon mitigation reasons rather than for development reasons could compromise both goals. The danger is supporting sub-optimal policies for mitigating carbon and for rural energy. This is problematic given the limited funds available for energy development and reducing greenhouse gases. This paper analyzes how these goals have been balanced by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Project documents are used to determine whether incremental costs of installing renewables were covered by GEF funds and whether the costs are comparable with other carbon mitigation options. The results raise concerns about the effectiveness and appropriateness of GEF funding of such projects and highlight the importance of post-Kyoto framework design to reduce emissions and promote development.

If all parts of the livestock production lifecycle are included (fossil fuels used to produce mineral fertilizers used in feed production and N(2)O emissions from fertilizer use; methane release from the breakdown of fertilizers and from animal manure; land-use changes for feed production and for grazing; land degradation; fossil fuel use during feed and animal production; fossil fuel use in production and transport of processed and refrigerated animal products), livestock are estimated to account for 18% of global anthropogenic emissions, but less than 8% in the UK. In terms of GHG emissions per unit of livestock product, monogastric livestock are more efficient than ruminants; thus in the UK, while sheep and cattle accounted for 32% of meat production in 2006, they accounted for similar to 48% of GHG emissions associated with meat production. More efficient management of grazing lands and of manure can have a direct impact in decreasing emissions. Improving efficiency of livestock production through better breeding, health interventions or improving fertility can also decrease GHG emissions through decreasing the number of livestock required per unit product. Increasing the energy density of the diet has a dual effect, decreasing both direct emissions and the numbers of livestock per unit product, but, as the demands for food increase in response to increasing human population and a better diet in some developing countries, there is increasing competition for land for food v. energy-dense feed crops. Recalculating efficiencies of energy and protein production on the basis of human-edible food produced per unit of human-edible feed consumed gave higher efficiencies for ruminants than for monogastric animals, The policy community thus have difficult decisions to make in balancing the negative contribution of livestock to the environment against the positive benefit in terms of food security. The animal science community have a responsibility to provide an evidence base which is objective and holistic with respect to these two competing challenges.

Their circumstances are shaped by the occupations, lifestyles, environments and remoteness which characterise the diversity of rural communities. Many rural regions face threats to future sustainability and greater proportions of the aged reside in these areas.The emerging changes in Australia's climate over the past decade may be considered indicative of future trends, and herald amplification of these familiar challenges for rural communities. Such climate changes are likely to exacerbate existing health risks and compromise community infrastructure in some instances.This paper discusses climate change-related health risks facing older people in rural areas, with an emphasis on the impact of heat, drought and drying on rural and remote regions.

Increasing storm intensities, shifting rainfall patterns, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and other manifold alterations are being experienced around the world. Climate has never been constant in any location, but human-induced changes associated with greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use are new and rapidly shifting conditions for rural communities and regions across the planet. Rural sociologists have long been carving out the contours of this topic through research on family well-being, rural livelihoods, community, and the environment. Now climate change and subsequent policy responses present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of this article is to assess lines of research and theory that consider and direct our understanding of the impacts of climate change, the ways it might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global realignment. As climate-change impacts and policy responses begin to impinge on rural populations, the first line of resistance and participation will be the rural community. The distribution of rewards from climate-change mitigation is broad and diffuse; the distribution of costs, compromised livelihoods, and community disruption often is focused.									27	0	0	3	0	27	1	45	0036-0112	1549-0831		WOS:000275136600001		J	Veltman, Karin; Singh, Bhawna; Hertwich, Edgar G.

CCS is well-studied in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction potential and cost of implementation. Impacts on human health and the environment have, however, received considerably less attention. In this work, we present a first assessment of human health and environmental impacts of a postcombustion CO2 capture facility, focusing on emissions from amine-based scrubbing solvents and their degradation products to air. We develop characterization factors for human toxicity for monoethanolamine (MEA) as these were not yet available. On the basis of the limited information available, our assessment indicates that amine-based scrubbing results in a 10-fold increase in toxic impact on freshwater ecosystems and a minor increase in toxic impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. These increases are attributed to emissions of monoethanolamine. For all other impact categories, i.e., human toxicity, marine ecotoxicity, particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation, and terrestrial acidification, the CO2 capture facility performs equally well to a conventional NGCC power plant albeit substantial changes in flue gas composition. The oxidative degradation products of MEA, i.e., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and ammonia, do not contribute significantly to total environmental impacts.									131	5	0	35	0	134	0	68	0013-936X			WOS:000274347800054	20095561	J	Moss, Richard H.; Edmonds, Jae A.; Hibbard, Kathy A.; Manning, Martin R.; Rose, Steven K.; van Vuuren, Detlef P.; Carter, Timothy R.; Emori, Seita; Kainuma, Mikiko; Kram, Tom; Meehl, Gerald A.; Mitchell, John F.

The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.									2867	126	4	1001	16	2971	112	1426	0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000274394300028	20148028	J	Molyneaux, A.; Leyland, G.; Favrat, D.

This paper illustrates the application of a multi-objective and multi-modal evolutionary algorithm to facilitate the design and planning of a district heating network based on a combination of centralized and decentralized heat pumps combined with on-site cogeneration. Comparisons are made with an earlier study based on a single objective environomic optimisation of the same overall model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As national economies respond to the dual challenges of severe economic turbulence on the global scale and climate change mitigation, the health economy is coming under increasing pressure to respond. Indications for sharp reductions in budgets and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, are widespread.Aims In this paper an analysis is undertaken of the diverse forces acting on a typical health care enterprise. The forces, both economic and carbon related, are investigated in terms of their effects through the enterprise and across its boundaries on the supply, demand and waste sides. The overall aim is to show how the enterprise and whole supply chains may flip synchronously into a low-carbon evolutionary pathway.Objectives By illustrating how different elements of the health care enterprise may respond to these developments, diverse opportunities for cost reduction, carbon reduction and product (goods and services) development are identified. These opportunities involve a variety of waste reduction and energy and materials conservation measures as well as new ways of collaborating with other enterprises going through similar transformations. The overall objective is to show that the carbon-constrained health care enterprise and the low-carbon health economy in which it sits may broaden its role in the coming decades to include a degree of responsibility for the health of the environment. This broader role is likely to supplement and entangle with the traditional role of the health economy, currently focused narrowly on human health, and lead to extensive organisational transformation, and infrastructure and product developments.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	1356-1294	1365-2753		WOS:000274486200036	20367839	B	Cao Wensheng; Lu Xuesheng						liu, JT; Ni, WD		Modularized adsorption purification of natural gas on small scale LNG project								2010 THE SECOND CHINA ENERGY SCIENTIST FORUM, VOL 1-3								406	+						2010	2010	In the field of natural gas liquefaction, the small-scale natural gas liquefier has attracted more and more attention at home and abroad, due to its small volume, mobile transportation and quick start-up and shut-down, as well as being in skid-mounted package. The purified natural gas helps to reduce CO2 emission and protect atmosphere environment. This paper put forward the concept of modularized adsorption purification of natural gas. The breakthrough curve of natural gas was measured in a layered column of molecular sieve 3A and 13X. The combination and scheme of the various adsorption modules were also optimized which adopt competitive adsorption theory. The adsorption order of the pretreatment module is dehydration - desulfurization - decarbonization, and regeneration order is decarbonization desulfurization dehydration. The pretreatment technique of modularized adsorption purification can meet the rigorous liquefaction requirement of natural gas for different producing areas and gas properties.					2nd China Energy Scientist Forum2nd China Energy Scientist Forum	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010		Xuzhou, PEOPLES R CHINAXuzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			978-1-935068-37-2	WOS:000289812500079		J	KyungtaekOh								Climate Change Diplomacy of South Korea			한국의 기후변화 외교					21st centry Political Science Review	21세기정치학회보			20	1			197	214						2010	2010	Climate change diplomacy of South Korea has become more active since the beginning of the Lee Myung-bak government. One of the major steps in this direction was announced as South Korea would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from business-as-usual(BAU) emissions by 2020 although it is one of the non-AnnexI Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. South Korea also, suggesting establishment of NAMA Registry in Korea, advocated a voluntary registration of reduction goals, domestic mandatory implementation, and allowance of international measure, report, and verification. These kinds of active move was favorably viewed internationally and Korea maintained the status of non-AnnexI country which could reduce emissions in nonbinding ways.Climate change policy of Korea has changed from the three considerations. First, there has been strengthening international pressure on Korea to reduce emissions because Korea already had become a member of OECD. Second, economic consideration was a major factor in establishing Korea's new policy. Green Growth policy was considered as providing a solution for energy security and greenhouse gas reduction and opportunities for new economic growth at the same time. Third, President Lee's personal ambition for the environmental leader also played important role in policy change. However, the final evaluation of climate change diplomacy of South Korea mainly depends upon the establishment of domestic institutions which could carry out effective implementation. The government should also maintain a consistent policy and the National Assembly should be the center of environmental law making. Because Korean people support stronger climate policy, a policy environment for a more active climate diplomacy is even more favorable than before.				이명박정부에 들어와서 한국의 기후변화 외교는 이전의 방어적 입장에서 변화를 보이면서 보다 적극적으로 전개되기 시작했다. 그와 같은 현상으로 나타난 것이 BAU 대비 30%를 감축한다는 온실가스 감축목표의 발표이며, 한국을 비롯한 Non-Annex I 국가의 감축을 이끌어내기 위한 국제적 등록, 구속적 국내 이행, 국제적 검증 방식의 제안이다. 이와 같은 기후변화 외교는 국제사회에서 비교적 호의적으로 받아 들여졌고, 한국은 비의무감축국의 지위를 유지하면서, 동시에 자율적 감축이 가능하게 되는 외교의 성과를 거뒀다고 볼 수 있다.한국의 기후변화 외교가 보다 적극적 입장을 띠게 된 요인을 세 가지 들 수 있다. 첫째, 한국의 온실가스 의무감축을 요구하는 국제적 압력이 강화되었다. 한국의 국제경제적 위상이나 온실가스 배출량과 그 증가율을 볼 때, 한국이 2012년에 출범할 Post-Kyoto체제에서 어떠한 형태로든 감축을 회피하기는 어려운 상황이 되었다. 변화된 기후변화 외교의 두 번째 요인으로 들 수 있는 것은 적극적인 경제적 고려이다. 에너지안보의 확보와 신성장동력 발굴이라는 핵심적으로 중요한 경제적 과제들을 동시에 해결할 수 있는 돌파구로서 온실가스 감축을 주요 내용으로 하는 녹색성장 전략을 채택한 것이다. 그 결과로서 보다 적극적 기후변화 외교가 가능하게 되었다. 셋째, 녹색성장에 관한 지도자의 강한 의지도 기후변화 외교가 보다 적극적으로 변화한 요인으로 들 수 있다. 대통령이 되기 이전부터 가지고 있던 환경과 경제성장에 대한 이명박대통령의 관심이 녹색성장이란 개념을 통해 정치적으로 더욱 매력적인 상품이 되었다.그런데 이상에서 논의한 한국의 기후변화 외교가 진정한 성공을 거두기 위해서는 감축 약속을 효과적으로 이행할 수 있는 국내적 법과 제도의 구축이 뒤따라야 한다. 또한 정부는 신재생에너지 개발 지원 등에 있어서 지속적 정책을 유지해야 하며, 입법의 중심은 국회가 되는 것이 바람직하다. 마지막으로 국민의 의식은 정부의 더욱 적극적 기후변화 정책을 지지하는 것으로 나타남으로써, 정부가 자신 있게 기후변화 정책을 추진하는데 유리한 정책 환경이 조성되어 있다고 볼 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1229-5167			KJD:ART001446867		B	Fang, Xiujuan						Chen, WJ; Liao, XP; Zhu, YL		The Research on Changing Development Paths: from a High-carbon to Low-carbon Economy in China								ADVANCES IN ASIA-PACIFIC LOW CARBON ECONOMY								444	449						2010	2010	The contradiction between the environment and the development of economy is going more and more outstanding in the 21 century. Climate change mitigation also poses significant challenges for China and its energy development, historically highly energy-intensive. Examining this challenge, this paper considers how to choose effective path to achieve the transformation of the economy growth pattern from the energy-intensive and high-carbon to low-carbon and no-carbon under the current limits of economy, population, resource, environment, and technical conditions, etc. In the short term, energy efficiency provides large potential for mitigation. Changing energy structure, dependent to 70% on coal, is at least a medium-term challenge. The most transformative change is to an alteration industry structure, likely to take long to achieve. In the future, the carbon dioxide emissions will have to stop growing, stabilize and decline 40%-50% before mid-century in China. The challenge of climate change is a long-term challenge, requiring immediate action. This article is focus on seeking to shift development paths.

These include the problems of research capacity and funding, the need to find a new balance between competition and cooperation between research groups, and a need for a renewed focus on the empirical performance of buildings. The authors argue that conventional distinctions between research, development and the deployment of technologies are inappropriate for the built environment. A wider range of approaches to research is needed to enable researchers to engage more effectively with stakeholders throughout the research, development, and deployment process, to reduce the distinction between research and knowledge transfer, and to reduce the length of learning cycles. Without such developments, there is a risk that the energy and buildings research community will be reduced to commenting on accelerating developments in the real world and, at the same time, an increased risk that the massive investments currently being envisaged in the refurbishment and decarbonization of the built environment will underperform.									53	0	0	0	0	53	0	5	0961-3218			WOS:000276099100009		J	Williamson, Terry; Soebarto, Veronica; Radford, Antony				Soebarto, Veronica I/L-9401-2016	Soebarto, Veronica/0000-0003-1397-8414			Comfort and energy use in five Australian award-winning houses: regulated, measured and perceived								BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION				38	5			509	529	PII 926012616	10.1080/09613218.2010.494890				2010	2010	Building regulations in Australia and elsewhere are increasingly directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving an efficient use of energy and water. These regulations significantly impact on aspirations with regard to the building design. Five case study houses recognized in awards from the Australian Institute of Architects are investigated for whether they met the aim and criteria of the relevant regulations for energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reductions. Qualitative and quantitative issues surrounding their environmental performance are examined, including occupants' comfort and energy consumption. The findings suggest that the assessment processes underpinning the regulations do not correlate well with measured environmental performance, the perceptions of occupiers, and how these houses are actually designed and operated. The regulatory concept of 'meeting generic needs' fails to account for the diversity of socio-cultural understandings, the inhabitants' expectations and their behaviours. In particular, standards and regulations failed to predict adaptive comfort as well as the low-energy consumption in the five case study houses. A governance challenge is to evaluate the interaction of individual preferences, technical concerns, bio-climatic matters, and the socio-cultural context. The goals and behaviours of inhabitants must be recognized and rewarded because they benefit both the environment and the community.									10	0	0	0	0	10	1	14	0961-3218			WOS:000281364800007		J	Barker, Terry; Scrieciu, S.

We contribute with a different perspective by deploying a large-scale macro-econometric hybrid simulation model of the global energy-environment-economy (E3MG) adopting a "New Economics" approach. We use E3MG to assess the implications of a low-stabilization target of 400ppm CO2 equivalent by 2100, assuming both fiscal instruments and regulation. We assert that if governments adopt more stringent climate targets for rapid and early decarbonization, such actions are likely to induce more investment and increased technological change in favor of low-carbon alternatives. Contrary to the conventional view on the economics of climate change, a transition towards a low-carbon society as modeled with E3MG leads to macroeconomic benefits, especially in conditions of unemployment, with GDP slightly above a reference scenario, depending on use of tax or auction revenues. In addition, more stringent action can lead to higher benefits.									28	0	0	2	0	28	0	25	0195-6574			WOS:000284336100006		J	Nemet, G. F.; Holloway, T.; Meier, P.

It is well known that many strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions also decrease emissions of health-damaging air pollutants and precursor species, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. In a survey of previous studies we found a range of estimates for the air quality co-benefits of climate change mitigation of $2-196/tCO(2) with a mean of $49/tCO(2), and the highest co-benefits found in developing countries. These values, although of a similar order of magnitude to abatement cost estimates, are only rarely included in integrated assessments of climate policy. Full inclusion of these co-benefits would have pervasive implications for climate policy in areas including: optimal policy stringency, overall costs, distributional effects, robustness to discount rates, incentives for international cooperation, and the value of adaptation, forests, and climate engineering relative to mitigation. Under-valuation results in part from uncertainty in climatic damages, valuation inconsistency, and institutional barriers. Because policy debates are framed in terms of cost minimization, policy makers are unlikely to fully value air quality co-benefits unless they can be compared on an equivalent basis with the benefits of avoided climatic damages. While air quality co-benefits have been prominently portrayed as a hedge against uncertainty in the benefits of climate change abatement, this assessment finds that full inclusion of co-benefits depends on-rather than substitutes for-better valuation of climate damages.									184	1	0	40	1	186	4	89	1748-9326			WOS:000276097900008		J	Huan-Niemi, Ellen; Niemi, Janne; Niemi, Jyrki								Global Food Production under Alternative Scenarios								INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW				13	4			117	135						2010	2010	The aim of this study is to compare the conceivable baseline or "business as usual" scenario to four extreme alternative scenarios over the next two decades. The alternative extreme scenarios present the question of "what if" an extreme policy is implemented, what would be the forecasted impact on global food production and how the impact would differ from the plausible scenario. The baseline scenario includes the WTO draft proposal for the Doha Round, the Kyoto Protocol targets to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, and the scheduled reforms on the EU Common Agricultural Policy. The alternative scenarios are prolonged world economic recession, climate change mitigation policies with higher targets, complete removal of only EU agricultural subsidies, and total trade liberalisation for agriculture worldwide. The goal is to foresee the future under plausible and extreme circumstances or policy implementations in a rapidly changing environment for decision makers, interest groups, agribusiness firms and managers in order to support the process of policy and strategy planning.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	14	1559-2448			WOS:000298319200006		J	Gillon, Sean								Fields of dreams: negotiating an ethanol agenda in the Midwest United States								JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES				37	4			723	748	PII 927238847	10.1080/03066150.2010.512456				2010	2010	Corn ethanol production is central in the United States' agrofuels initiatives.

Proponents of biodiesel in Kenya have adopted a near-singular focus on Jatropha but attach it to a wide variety of goals, including climate change mitigation, poverty reduction, and clean development. The priorities of actors who promote the crop often differ from those of smallholder farmers who grow it. The persistence of multiple discourses of development linked to Jatropha creates tensions between competing perspectives, manifested through allegations of exclusion and shady business, but it also allows actors to deploy strategic flexibility by invoking Jatropha to pursue different ends. A case study of an internationally funded project in Mpeketoni, Coast Province highlights disconnects between the initial objectives of donors, coordinators, and farmers and explores the project's potential to produce outcomes that are satisfactory to all three. The paper contributes to wider debates about biofuels and discourses of development: Jatropha shares many features with past agricultural development interventions, but as a biofuel it exhibits additional layers of contested meaning because of the politics of energy and the environment that are involved.									41	0	0	7	0	41	0	0	0306-6150			WOS:000282133800016		J	Dwyer, Larry; Forsyth, Peter; Spurr, Ray; Hoque, Serajul								Estimating the carbon footprint of Australian tourism								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				18	3			355	376	PII 919028692	10.1080/09669580903513061				2010	2010	This paper explores the issues in estimating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the tourism industry and related activity in Australia. The scope of tourism consists of the economic activities defined as otourism characteristico and otourism connectedo as defined in the Australian Tourism Satellite Account (TSA). Two approaches are employed and contrasted - a oproduction approacho and an oexpenditure approacho. Depending on the approach, tourism contributes between 3.9% and 5.3% of total industry GHG in Australia. The rationale for each approach is explained. The GHG emissions have been estimated for 2003-2004, the latest year for which detailed industry GHG emissions data are available in a form suitable for this type of analysis. Tourism's GHG emissions are compared with other industries in the Australian economy. The policy implications of the results are discussed. It should be possible to adopt a broadly similar method for any destination with TSA - enabling tourism stakeholders to play an informed role in assessing appropriate and effective climate change mitigation strategies for their destination.									93	13	0	3	0	106	6	49	0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000277591300005		B	Sundha, Parul; Melkania, Uma						Baby, S; Sandhu, PS		Characterization of Biochar for soil carbon pool enrichment: Review on a way to carbon sequestration								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (ICEST 2010)								550	554		10.3850/978-981-08-5716-5_T341				2010	2010	The intensification of agricultural production on a global scale has become the need of hour to fulfill the food supply of increasing world population. As a result, more and more organic carbon is being removed from the soil leading to dramatic soil degradation. Over-exploitation of soils has depleted an enormous amount of soil organic carbon.One method of increasing the soil health is through the application of biochar (carbonized material) that have long term stability. The term biochar refers to black carbon formed by the pyrolysis of biomass i.e. by heating the biomass in an oxygen-free or low oxygen environment such that it does not combust. The definition adopted by International Biochar Initiative (IBI) further emphasizes on its application on agricultural lands. The charred material has highly porous structure, potentially responsible for improved water retention and increased soil surface area.The study of physical and chemical properties of biochar has led to the conclusion that it may serve as a long term source of organic carbon, reduce leaching of organic and inorganic fertilizers and has potential to increase the soil productivity. It also increases the water holding capacity of soil and its nutrient use efficiency. Although some evidences exist that it can reduce the soil emissions of N2O and CH4. Therefore, it may help in climate change mitigation. Further studies in this field may help in better understanding of its interaction with soil.

The changes in diet related to reducing animal products and increasing vegetable comsumption not only produce benefits for human health and on the overall utilization of land, but can also play a decisive role in the policies of climate change mitigation. The Mediterranean, being understood not only as a concrete set of foods but also as a cultural incorporating the ways foods are produced and processed, is an example of sustainability, in wich biodiversity is also key.Sustainability should be considered as a fundamental element when planning and defining community nutrition interventions and should constitute a key issue in the agenda for climate change mitigation.

Negotiating Sustainability: Climate Change Framing in the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union								SYMBOLIC INTERACTION				33	1			115	140		10.1525/si.2010.33.1.115				JAN 2010	2010	Environmental problems are often reduced to a catch-22 that portrays sustainability-oriented policies as disastrous for resource sector workers. Despite efforts by many industry leaders to frame climate change in "jobs versus environment" terms, the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) has supported ambitious greenhouse gas reduction policies. Using interviews with union members and staff, this study examines CEP's climate change framing. It finds that CEP extended the environmental justice master frame to define its response to climate change, neutralize anti-Kyoto rhetoric, and work with the environmental movement. CEP's framing was accomplished through negotiation processes that continue to unfold as members work out the union's positions relative to their own values, experiences, and interpretations of what is possible. These findings suggest sustainability can be understood as an emergent, localized, and contested social order, and point to "self-negotiation" in longer-term social change struggles as a potential area of further study.									6	0	0	1	0	7	0	13	0195-6086			WOS:000274156000007		S	Houghton, John W.

For each setting, we compared a business-as-usual 2030 projection (without policies for reduction of greenhouse gases) with alternative scenarios-lower-carbon-emission motor vehicles, increased active travel, and a combination of the two. We developed separate models that linked transport scenarios with physical activity, air pollution, and risk of road traffic injury. in both cities, we noted that reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through an increase in active travel and less use of motor vehicles had larger health benefits per million population (7332 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] in London, and 12 516 in Delhi in 1 year) than from the increased use of lower-emission motor vehicles (160 DALYs in London, and 1696 in Delhi). However, combination of active travel and lower-emission motor vehicles would give the largest benefits (7439 DALYs in London, 12 995 in Delhi), notably from a reduction in the number of years of life lost from ischaemic heart disease (10-19% in London, 11-25% in Delhi). Although uncertainties remain, climate change mitigation in transport should benefit public health substantially. Policies to increase the acceptability, appeal, and safety of active urban travel, and discourage travel in private motor vehicles would provide larger health benefits than would policies that focus solely on lower-emission motor vehicles.									490	0	0	118	4	492	16	240	0140-6736	1474-547X		WOS:000272646900026	19942277	J	Rist, Lucy; Lee, Janice Ser Huay; Koh, Lian Pin				Koh, Lian Pin/A-5794-2010; rist, lucy/K-5412-2013	Koh, Lian Pin/0000-0001-8152-3871; Lee, Janice Ser Huay/0000-0001-6368-6212			Biofuels: Social Benefits								SCIENCE				326	5958			1344	1344		10.1126/science.326.5958.1344-a				DEC 4 2009	2009										9	1	0	3	0	10	1	14	0036-8075			WOS:000272351100013	19965736	J	Rosenberg, Norman J.; Smith, Steven J.

But the world's land resources are far too varied in their soils, native and managed vegetation, water resources and climatic norms and extremes to expect that a single, globally comprehensive strategy can be applied to meet such goals. Rather, lessons to guide programs aimed at achieving sustainability can be assembled from experience gained in discrete geographic, climatic and edaphic regions. One such region is the semiarid to subhumid North American Great Plains (hereafter NAGP), a region that since settlement has experienced many periods of economic boom and many of economic distress. Originally a grassland, its vulnerability to soil erosion, environmental problems associated with the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and the overuse of surface and ground water is typical of other important grasslands converted to agriculture in South America and in the European and central Asiatic regions of the former Soviet Union. In addition, there is reason to believe that many of these grassland regions, most located in continental interiors, may be further stressed by climate changes caused by rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. One action that can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation is the production of herbaceous biomass, for which the NAGP region is well suited. This paper reviews the geography, history and current condition of the NAGP and offers suggestions about how the agriculture, economy and environment of this and similar regions around the world can be made more sustainable and able to contribute to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions and consequent global warming.									6	0	0	4	0	6	0	20	1877-3435			WOS:000282613300002		J	Haines, Andy; McMichael, Anthony J.; Smith, Kirk R.; Roberts, Ian; Woodcock, James; Markandya, Anil; Armstrong, Ben G.; Campbell-Lendrum, Diarmid; Dangour, Alan D.; Davies, Michael; Bruce, Nigel; Tonne, Cathryn; Barrett, Mark; Wilkinson, Paul				Azkarate, Ainhoa/K-9087-2013; Tonne, Cathryn/F-5020-2017; Markandya, Anil/K-9381-2013	Azkarate, Ainhoa/0000-0003-0471-3094; Tonne, Cathryn/0000-0003-3919-8264; Dangour, Alan/0000-0001-6908-1273; Woodcock, James/0000-0003-4769-5375			Health and Climate Change 6 Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers								LANCET				374	9707			2104	2114		10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61759-1				DEC-JAN 2009	2009	This Series has examined the health implications of policies aimed at tackling climate change. Assessments of mitigation strategies in four domains-household energy, transport, food and agriculture, and electricity generation-suggest an important message: that actions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions often, although not always, entail net benefits for health. In some cases, the potential benefits seem to be substantial. This evidence provides an additional and immediate rationale for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions beyond that of climate change mitigation alone. Climate change is an increasing and evolving threat to the health of populations worldwide. At the same time, major public health burdens remain in many regions. Climate change therefore adds further urgency to the task of addressing international health priorities, such as the UN Millennium Development Goals. Recognition that mitigation strategies can have substantial benefits for both health and climate protection offers the possibility of policy choices that are potentially both more cost effective and socially attractive than are those that address these priorities independently.									239	4	0	74	4	243	2	84	0140-6736			WOS:000273122900034	19942281	J	Bloodworth, A.

Digging the backyard: Mining and quarrying in the UK and their impact on future land use								LAND USE POLICY				26		SI		S317	S325		10.1016/j.landusepol.2009.08.022			1	DEC 2009	2009	The future demand for land for mining and quarrying will be affected by a large number of economic, technological, environmental and social issues within the UK. Global developments also have a role to play. Although mining and quarrying account for only 0.9 per cent of the land area of England, the impact of this activity is considerable. Minerals are essential to the economy, for energy, construction, infrastructure and manufacturing, while their extraction has effects on the environment and on public perception. This paper examines current scientific understanding of the context of mining and quarrying. with particular reference to its impact on land use, along with the spatial relationship between minerals - which can only be worked where they occur - and other forms of land use and designation in the 'post-industrial' landscape of Britain. Looking out to 2060 and beyond, developments which may influence demand for minerals include climate change mitigation and adaptation; energy, food and raw material security; and new construction, manufacturing, recycling and re-use technologies. Factors influencing the supply side include the structure and ownership of the mining and quarrying industry, new extraction, processing and environmental technologies, ecosystem service provision, societal attitudes and land access. Although prediction carries a high level of uncertainty. continuous development of the regulatory framework is, and will remain, a major and pervasive factor in the relationship between mining and quarrying and land use.

Less than half of this C stays in the atmosphere. The remainder is taken up by the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. Where does the C come from and where and when does this uptake occur? We address these questions by providing new estimates of regional land-use emissions and natural carbon fluxes for the 1700-2000 period, simultaneously considering multiple anthropogenic (e.g. land and energy demand) and biochemical factors in a geographically explicit manner. The observed historical atmospheric CO(2) concentration profile for the 1700 to 2000 period has been reproduced well. The terrestrial natural biosphere has been a major carbon sink, due to changes in climate, atmospheric CO(2), nitrogen and management. Due to land-use change large amounts of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere. The net effect was an emission of 35 Pg C into the atmosphere for the 1700 to 2000 period. If land use had remained constant at its distribution in 1700, then the terrestrial C uptake would have increased by 142 Pg C. This overall difference of including or excluding land-use changes (i.e. 177 Pg C) comes to more than half of the historical fossil-fuel related emissions of 308 Pg C. Historically, global land-use emissions were predominantly caused by the expansion of cropland and pasture, while wood harvesting (for timber and fuel wood) only played a minor role. These findings are robust even when changing some of the important drivers like the extent of historical land-use changes. Under varying assumptions, land-use emissions over the past three centuries could have increased up to 20%, but remained significantly lower than from other sources. Combining the regional land-use and natural C fluxes, North America and Europe were net C sources before 1900, but turned into sinks during the twentieth century. Nowadays, these fluxes are a magnitude smaller than energy- and industry-related emissions. Tropical regions were C neutral prior to 1950, but then accelerated deforestation turned these regions into major C sources. The energy- and industry-related emissions are currently increasing in many tropical regions, but are still less than the land-use emissions. Based on the presented relevance of the land-use and natural fluxes for the historical C cycle and the significance of fossil-fuel emissions nowadays, there is a need for an integrated approach for energy, nature and land use in evaluating possible climate change mitigation policies.									36	3	0	21	0	38	1	60	0165-0009			WOS:000270979600009		J	Meinke, Holger; Howden, S.

Although most agricultural producers respond rapidly to changes in their external environment, science needs to play an important, partial role in instigating adaptation actions that go beyond the ongoing, experience-based response process. This requires well-structured, conceptual frameworks that connect science with action. These frameworks must also ensure that the scientific input into the adaptation process remains salient, credible and legitimate. For the field of agriculture and environmental sciences we review the urgency and the theoretical basis for such engagement processes. On the basis of this we propose an adaptation cycle that first, provides a reflective analysis-action continuum; second, ensures broad-based scientific input and feedback; and third, helps to increase the adaptive capacity of everyone involved (including farmers, policy-makers and scientists).									100	0	0	41	1	101	1	35	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000282413600010		J	Tamiotti, Ludivine; Kulacoglu, Vesile								National Climate Change Mitigation Measures and Their Implications for the Multilateral Trading System: Key Findings of the WTO/UNEP Report on Trade and Climate Change								JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE				43	5			1115	1144						OCT 2009	2009	This article presents the key findings of the final chapter of the recently published World Trade non (WTO)/United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report on Trade and Climate Change.

Critical discourse analysis of climate and energy policy unveils Sweden's ambition to 'lead-by-example', by virtue of a win-win combination of economy and environment via stringent regulations and an early-mover strategy on eco-innovations. The extent of the unilateral approach is constrained by concerns for the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries and a persistent debate on the fate of Swedish nuclear power.

China's industrial and service sectors are expected to maintain rapid development over the next decades, driving up the demand for electric power and heat. However, China's power and industrial process heat generation are heavily relying upon coal-fired thermal power plants resulting in tremendous rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Clean technology such as concentrating solar thermal (CST) needs to play a more important role in power and heat generation in China to accelerate the decarbonisation in the power sector and commercial and industrial process heat generation cost-effectively. This paper attempts to explore the opportunity and challenge of development and deployment of CST in China from both technical and socioeconomic analysis perspectives. It is argued that rapid deployment of CST in China will contribute to enabling sustainable energy supply and environmental securities, as well as improved economic performance in new technology innovation in Asia Pacific area over the next decades. Supportive policy framework should be set up to encourage scaling up CST industry. The success of deployment of CST technology will also allow Chinese power and heat generators to strengthen their competitiveness in the context of intensified global constraint of carbon emissions. Institutional innovation and policy instruments for scaling up this technology and the enabling conditions of successful implementation are also investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze indicators of strategic behavior through three measures of engagement with the VCR program ( annual participation behavior, quality of action plans and repeat participation), and test for differences in these measures among firms subjected to different regulatory climates that arise over time, across provinces and across economic sectors. Our findings suggest an increased perception of a regulatory threat in later years, as evidenced by an increase in participation rates, higher quality of action plans and higher rates of repeat participation. We also find higher levels of engagement with the VCR program in provinces with large petroleum ( Alberta) and manufacturing ( Ontario) industries and that have established provincial level greenhouse gas reporting mechanisms, and in certain sectors such as petroleum, electric utilities and to some extent services.

The present paper revisits these debates and synthesizes the longstanding arguments. Firstly, it provides an overview of the development of international climate policy and discusses clashing positions, represented by sceptics and supporters of action on climate change. Secondly, it discusses the market-based measures as a means to increase the win-win opportunities and to attract profit-minded investors to invest in climate change mitigation. Finally, the paper examines whether climate protection policies can yield benefits both for the environment and the economy. A new breed of analysts are identified who are convinced of the climate change problem, while remaining sceptical of the proposed solutions. The paper suggests the integration of climate policies with those of development priorities that are vitally important for developing countries and stresses the need for using sustainable development as a framework for climate change policies.

This study presents the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework for assessing the causes and effects of climate change involved with the built environment at different scales with a case study of Seoul, South Korea. The Seoul metro region is the sixth most densely populated area in the world, and the region's rapid population growth has resulted in dramatic increases in both energy consumption and land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes. South Korea is now the ninth largest Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emitter in the world and the third largest in Asia. Our results indicate that the system inputs and impacts of the proposed framework (urban population, LULC change, greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and energy consumption) are closely related to the system pressures of energy security and GHG-reduction requirements. To meet the goal for the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol, Seoul must cut down its annual CO2 emissions by 3.4 million metric tons. The city's current intervention strategies will result in a reduction of only 2.1 million metric tons a year, a deficit of 1.3 million metric tons. Our preliminary results indicate that the Seoul government can strengthen its CO2 reduction strategy by incorporating built environment factors from the Sustainable Urban Systems Framework. By adopting energy-efficient-building standards, CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 1.34 million metric tons per year, suggesting a promising approach to lowering the city's energy use and GHG emissions.

There are concerns that such large-scale land conversion will conflict with food production and impact on the environment. Perennial biomass crops could be grown on more marginal agricultural land. However, for sustainable solutions, biomass yields will need to be sufficient and the wider implications of land-use changes considered. Here, focusing on Miscanthus in England as an example, we combined an empirical model with GIS to produce a yield map and estimated regional energy generation potentials after masking out areas covered by environmental and socio-economic factors which could preclude the planting of energy crops. Agricultural land quality and the distributions of currently grown food crops were then taken into account. Results showed that: (i) regional contrasts occur in the importance of different factors affecting biomass planting; (ii) areas with the highest biomass yields co-locate with food producing areas on high grade land, and; (iii) when such high grade land and unsuitable areas are excluded, a policy-related scenario for increased planting on 350,000 ha utilised 4-28% (depending on the region) of lower grade land and would not necessarily greatly impact on UK food security. We conclude that the GIS-based yield and suitability mapping described here can help identify important issues in bioenergy generation potentials and land use implications at regional or finer spatial scales that would be missed in analyses at the national level.									92	0	0	45	0	92	0	78	1939-1234	1939-1242		WOS:000278487600003		J	Yuan, Joshua S.; Himanen, Sari J.; Holopainen, Jarmo K.; Chen, Feng; Stewart, C.

Global climate change factors, such as increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, ozone and temperature, could alter how insects perceive such compounds. Here we review recent research on the influence of climate change parameters on the ecological functions of VOCs, with specific focus on terpenoids, the best-characterized VOCs. We summarize how emission patterns and concentrations of VOCs could change in future environments, mainly from the perspectives of plant defense and stress responses. We discuss how higher carbon dioxide concentrations, elevated ozone levels and increased temperatures could affect the biological functions of VOCs, particularly their role in plant defense.									98	5	0	89	1	102	6	107	0169-5347	1872-8383		WOS:000267008900006	19324451	J	Li, Qi; Wu, Zhishen; Li, Xiaochun				Li, Qi/F-5257-2011	Li, Qi/0000-0003-0679-4385			Prediction of CO2 leakage during sequestration into marine sedimentary strata								ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT				50	3			503	509		10.1016/j.enconman.2008.11.011				MAR 2009	2009	Deep ocean storage of CO2 could help reduce the atmospheric level of greenhouse gas as part of a climate change mitigation strategy. In this paper, a multiphase flow model of CO2 sequestration into deep ocean sediments was designed associated with the formation of CO2 hydrates. A simplified assumption was proposed to predict the critical time of CO2 leakage from marine sedimentary strata into seawater. Moreover, some principal parameters, which include the permeability, anisotropy, total injection amount, and length of the injection part of wellbores, were investigated by numerical simulations. The numerical estimates are used to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of CO2 storage in deep ocean sediments. Accurately predicting the actual fate of liquid CO2 sequestered into the marine sedimentary strata at depths greater than 500 m is complicated by uncertainties associated with not only the chemical-physical behavior of CO2 under such conditions but also the geo-environment of disposal sites. Modeling results have shown some implications that the effectiveness of CO2 ocean sequestration depends mainly on the injection conditions (such as injection rate, total injection amount, and the depth of injection), the site geology (such as permeability and anisotropy of disposal formations), and the chemical-physical behavior of CO2 in marine environment.

Brant								Interfacial Tension between CO2, Freshwater, and Brine in the Range of Pressure from (2 to 27) MPa, Temperature from (20 to 125) degrees C, and Water Salinity from (0 to 334 000) mg(.)L(-1)								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA				54	3			765	775		10.1021/je800529x				MAR 2009	2009	An extensive laboratory program was conducted for the measurement of the interfacial tension between CO2 and water or brine covering the ranges of (2 to 27) MPa pressure, (20 to 125) degrees C temperature, and (0 to 334 010) mg(.)L(-1) water salinity. The laboratory experiments were conducted using the pendant drop method combined with the solution of the Laplace equation for capillarity for the profile of the brine drop in the CO2-brine equilibrium environment. The analysis of the resulting set of 378 IFT measurements reveals that: (1) under conditions of constant temperature and water salinity, IFT steeply decreases with increasing pressure in the range P < P-c and mildly decreases for P > P-c with an asymptotic trend toward a constant value at higher pressures; (2) under the same conditions of constant pressure and temperature, IFT increases with increasing water salinity, reflecting decreasing CO2 solubility in brine as salinity increases; (3) the dependence of IFT on temperature is more complex than that on either pressure or salinity, depending on the CO2 phase. For T < T-c, IFT increases with increasing temperature, and around the critical point (T approximate to T-c), IFT significantly decreases (believed to be associated with the fact that at T-c the IFT between CO2 liquid and vapor phases tends to zero) and then increases again with increasing temperature for T > T-c with an asymptotic trend toward a constant value for high temperatures. The dependence of IFT on pressure, temperature, and water salinity for CO2 and water/brine systems can be well approximated by a power function of pressure whose coefficient and exponent depend on temperature and water salinity. These results indicate that, in the case Of CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers as a climate-change mitigation strategy, the formation water displacement by injected CO2 during the injection (drainage) phase of CO2 storage and the possible subsequent CO2 displacement by invading brine during the CO2 migration (imbibition) phase depend on in situ conditions of pressure, temperature, and water salinity through the effects that these primary variables have on the IFT between CO2 and aquifer brine.									167	4	0	10	0	171	3	51	0021-9568			WOS:000264197700015		J	Whitmarsh, Lorraine				Whitmarsh, Lorraine/A-1611-2010; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/AAD-3756-2019	Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040; Whitmarsh, Lorraine/0000-0002-9054-1040			Behavioural responses to climate change: Asymmetry of intentions and impacts								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				29	1			13	23		10.1016/j.jenvp.2008.05.003				MAR 2009	2009	In seeking to determine whether climate change mitigation strategies are effective, researchers and policy-makers typically use energy consumption as all indicator. UK government data show that energy use amongst the Public is rising, despite measures to encourage energy conservation. Yet, research to date has not explicitly asked which actions the public are taking with the express intention of mitigating climate change. Using Stern's classification of impact-oriented and intent-oriented behaviour research, tire research described in this paper examines both actions taken 'out of concern for climate change' and energy conservation practices amongst the UK public. The findings show a clear divergence between actions prescribed by policy-makers (i.e. energy conservation) and those taken by the public to mitigate climate change (e.g.. recycling). Furthermore, those who take action to conserve energy generally do so for reasons unconnected to the environment (e.g., to save money). Regression analyses highlight the distinct determinants of these two behavioural categories. These findings imply that surveys using energy reduction as in indicator of Public response to climate change falsely assume that these can be equated; Consequently, they Will provide a distorted picture of behavioural response. Possible reasons for the asymmetry of intentions and impacts, and policy implications, are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

IEEE					Allocation of Emission Allowances to Effectively Reduce Emissions in Electricity Generation								2009 IEEE POWER & ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING, VOLS 1-8		IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM						2123	+						2009	2009	A huge opportunity exists within the electricity generation industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus making a significant contribution to climate change mitigation. Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), member countries are allocated national emission quotas which they further distribute among their individual industry sectors. Within the UK, the electricity generation industry already plays a significant role in the reduction of green house emissions. Emissions trading mechanisms should make it more attractive to build capacity in renewable and cleaner generation than buying rights to emit since more still needs to be done to reduce emissions. To achieve this it is essential that the right emission quotas are allocated for different industries. The amount of emissions to be allocated to the generation industry must therefore be consistent with the desired emissions reduction target and the current technological status of the generation mix. The allocation must also take into account the relative costs of cleaner and renewable generation technologies that are commercially available and those in developments. This paper proposes an approach for determining the emissions allocation for the generation industry to achieve a given emission reduction target. The paper draws on previous work on valuing emissions from electricity generation and building a sustainable generation mix in a competitive environment. Studies were carried out with seven generation technologies. The studies demonstrate that when compared with energy markets alone, emission trading schemes have significant influence in future generation mix and its consequential technology and generation costs as well as emission reductions. Appropriate emission allocation scheme encourages a cost-effective, sustainable generation mix to develop without distorting competition.

As a result, provision of ecosystem services is sub-optimal and estimation of their values is complicated. We examine how econometric estimation can feed computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling to estimate health-related ecosystem values. Against a back drop of climate change, we analyze the Brazilian policy to expand National Forests (FLONAS) by 50 million hectares. Because these major environmental changes can generate spillovers in other sectors, we develop and use a CGE model that focuses on land and labor markets. Compared to climate change and deforestation in the baseline, the FLONAS scenario suggests relatively small declines in GDP, output (including agriculture) and other macro indicators. Urban households will experience declines in their welfare because they own most of the capital and land, which allows them to capture most of the deforestation benefits. In contrast, even though rural households have fewer opportunities for subsistence agriculture and face additional competition with other rural agricultural workers for more limited employment, their welfare improves due to health benefits from conservation of nearby forests. The efficiency vs. equity tradeoffs implied by the FLONAS scenario suggests that health-related ecosystem services will be underprovided if the rural poor are politically weaker than the urban rich. In conclusion, we briefly discuss the pros and cons of the CGE strategy for valuing ecosystem-mediated health benefits and evaluating contemporary policies on climate change mitigation.									16	0	0	8	0	16	1	28	1935-1682			WOS:000270379800001		J	Gurney, Andrew; Ahammad, Helal; Ford, Melanie								The economics of greenhouse gas mitigation: Insights from illustrative global abatement scenarios modelling								ENERGY ECONOMICS				31				S174	S186		10.1016/j.eneco.2009.08.016			2	2009	2009	In this paper the Global Trade and Environment Model (GTEM) and MAGICC are used to simulate a number of global emission mitigation scenarios devised by the EMF 22 Transition Scenarios group in which radiative forcing goals and the architecture of developing economies' participation in hypothetical mitigation actions are varied. This paper presents a reference case of the world economy to 2100 and analyses some key regional and global results for the various global mitigation scenarios, including emission prices, emission levels, primary energy consumption and economic growth.Modelling results suggest that a transition to a low-carbon world would require a significant decarbonisation of electricity generation without necessarily cutting the electricity output in the long run. With the uptake of hybrids and non-fossil-fuel technologies, the transport sector could make an important contribution to global abatement of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, with substantial international mitigation efforts and uptake of low- and/or zero-emission technologies, the achievement of 3.7 W/m(2) and 4,5 W/m(2) radiative forcing targets by the end of the century could occur at emission prices of up to $550/t CO2-e. However, achieving the 2.6 W/m(2) (overshoot) radiative forcing target would require considerably higher emission prices and an immediate global mitigation action.

Energy models at global, national, and provincial levels are effective tools used for examining these interactions. However, these models are inadequate for a city-cluster jurisdiction such as the Toronto-Niagara Region (TNR), Canada, which has unique economic and energy characteristics. The objective of this study is to develop a City-cluster Energy Systems Planning Model (CCEM) and apply it to the TNR as a case study. It is demonstrated that the model can be effectively used for supporting energy planning, environmental management, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in a city-cluster jurisdiction.									18	1	0	1	0	18	1	8	1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000262861100001		J	Bambrick, Hilary J.; Woodruff, Rosalie E.; Hanigan, Ivan C.

This has implications for the safety and supply of fresh blood products around the world. In Australia, a recent outbreak of dengue fever caused a prolonged regional shortage in the supply of fresh blood products.Objective: To highlight the potential for climate change to affect the safety and supply of blood globally through its impact on vector-borne disease, using the example of dengue in Australia as a case-study.Design: We modelled geographic regions in Australia suitable for dengue transmission over the coming century under four climate change scenarios, estimated changes to the population at risk and effect on blood supply.Results: Geographic regions with climates that are favourable to dengue transmission could expand to include large population centres in a number of currently dengue-free regions in Australia and reduce blood supply across several states.Conclusion: Unless there is strong intergovernmental action on greenhouse gas reduction, there could be an eight-fold increase in the number of people living in dengue prone regions in Australia by the end of the century. Similar impacts will be experienced elsewhere and for other vector-borne diseases, with regions currently on the margins of transmission zones most affected. Globally, climate change is likely to compound existing problems of blood safety and supply in already endemic areas and cause future shortages in fresh blood products through its impact on transmission of vector-borne disease.									11	0	0	5	0	11	0	12	1654-9880			WOS:000208160000016	20052315	J	Tang, Zhenghong; Hussey, Christopher M.; Wei, Ting								Assessing local land use planning's awareness, analysis, and actions for climate change								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT				1	4			368	381		10.1108/17568690911002898				2009	2009	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the previous larger-scale climate policy studies to the local jurisdiction level to evaluate local land use planning capacity for climate change.Design/methodology/approach - This paper evaluated 53 recently developed local comprehensive land use plans in California and analyzes how well these plans recognized the concepts of climate change and prepared for climate change mitigation and adaptation.Findings - The descriptive results show that local land use plans reflect very low awareness and little analysis for climate change; however, the actions for climate change varied widely in scope and content in their plans.Originality/value - This paper provides policymakers important empirical evidence to improve local land use planning capacities for climate change.									8	0	0	0	0	8	0	13	1756-8692			WOS:000207915400005		J	Barker, Terry; Scrieciu, S.

Since the Industrial Revolution in 17th century, human beings have increasingly exploited the world’s natural capital, such as the natural environment and its ecosystems. Now the world is facing limits to sustainable economic growth because of limits to this natural capital. Thus, most countries are beginningto adopt a new development paradigm, the so-called『Green Development Paradigm』 which pursues environmental conservation in parallel with economic growth. Recently, the Korean government announced an ambitious national policy of Low Carbon & Green Growth for the next six decades. This is an important step that transforms the existing national policy into a new future-oriented one. The fisheries sector in particular has great potential for making a substantial contribution to this national policy initiative. Forexample, the ocean itself with its sea plants and phytoplankton has an enormous capacity for fixing carbon, and its vast areas of tidal flats have a tremendous potential for cleaning up pollutants from both the sea andthe land. Furthermore, the fishing industry has great potential for the development of fuel-saving biodegradable technologies, and a long-tail economy based on digital technologies can do much to promote the production and consumption of green goods and services derived from the oceans and the fisheries. In order for this potential to be realized, the fisheries authority needs to develop a new green-growth strategy that is practical and widely supported by fishing communities and the markets, taking into account the need for greenhouse gas reduction, conservation of the ocean environment and ecosystems, an improved system for seafood safety, the establishment of strengthened MCS (monitoringÂ·controlÂ·surveillance) system, and the development of coastal ecotourism. In addition, fisheries green policies need to be implemented through a well-organized system of government aids, regulations and compensation, and spontaneous (voluntary)orders in fishing communities should be promoted to encourage far more responsible fisheries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1598-141X			KJD:ART001328292		S	Kuhi-Thalfeldt, R.; Kuhi-Thalfeldt, A.; Valtin, J.

Solar energy is abundant, provides an important saving to the consumer, and contributes to a personal comfort without environmental damage. One of the most attractive applications of solar energy is for hot water usage in the public and commercial sector. The available building surface for the residential, commercial and industrial sector is approximately 110,000,000 m(2). Hence, the potential for solar heaters for Malaysia is 75 GW(thermal). There are over 100 hospitals and hotels throughout the nation that the existing hot water system can be converted to solar assisted system and hence increase the market of the solar energy systems. Hospitals and hotels utilized over 30 % of the total energy consumption for water heating. A case study of such facilities is the Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM)) was presented. Presently, cold water enters the calorifiers directly, which are heated by LPG boilers. Boiling time is relatively long, hence larger amount of LPG is used and much amount of greenhouse gases is released. The hot water system for the hospital is provided by a boiler with a capacity of 2.1 million kcal/hr. The fuel used is LPG. A total of eight calorifiers are used. Each calorifier has a capacity of 13,500 litre/hr. The unit is running 24 hours a day. The average solar radiation for Kuala Lumpur is 16.92 MJ / m2 / day. The evacuated tube collectors with all the required controls system have been proposed. Simple calculations on the energy output, savings on LPG and reduction of CO2 have been conducted. Prelimanary results indicated that the saving on LPG based on proposed system was more than 20%. With a prospect of 100 hospitals and hotels throughout the nation, this project shall improve public awareness in energy conservation in the hot water production of their buildings and increase the market of the solar energy systems.

Population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted among 1202 respondents in Portland OR and Houston TX between June and September 2007 regarding awareness, concern, and behavior change related to climate change. The data were subjected to both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Awareness about climate change is virtually universal (98% in Portland and 92% in Houston) with the vast majority reporting some level of concern (90% in Portland and 82% in Houston). A multivariate analysis revealed significant predictors of behavior change: individuals with heightened concern about climate change (p < 0.001); respondents with higher level of education (p = 0.03); younger compared with older individuals (p < 0.001); and Portlanders more likely to change behavior compared with Houstonians (p < 0.001). Of those who changed behavior, 43% reported having reduced their energy usage at home, 39% had reduced gasoline consumption, and 26% engaged in other behaviors, largely recycling. Qualitative data indicate a number of cognitive, behavioral, and structural obstacles to voluntary mitigation. Although consumers are interested in global climate change-mitigation strategies and willing to act accordingly, considerable impediments remain. Government policy must eliminate economic, structural, and social barriers to change and advance accessible and economical alternatives. Individual-level mitigation can be a policy option under favorable contextual conditions, as these results indicate, but must be accompanied by mitigation efforts from industry, commerce, and government.									207	3	0	47	6	215	2	102	0749-3797	1873-2607		WOS:000260396600012	18929974	J	Louis, Michael E.

In recent years, global health efforts in those same countries have grown dramatically. However, the emerging scientific consensus about climate change has not yet had much influence on the routine practice and strategies of global health. We review here the anticipated types and global distribution of health impacts of climate change, discuss relevant aspects of current global interventions for health in low-income countries, and consider potential elements of a framework for appropriately and efficiently mainstreaming global climate change-mitigation and -adaptation strategies into the ongoing enterprise of global health. We propose a collaborative learning initiative involving four areas: (1) increased awareness among current global health practitioners of climate change and its potential impacts for the most disadvantaged, (2) strengthening of the evidence base, (3) incorporation now of climate change-mitigation and -adaptation concerns into design of ongoing global health programs, and (4) alignment of current global health program targets and methods with larger frameworks for climate change and sustainable development. The great vulnerability to climate change of populations reached by current global health efforts should prompt all concerned with global health to take a leading role in advocating for climate change mitigation in their own countries.									63	0	1	19	1	67	1	29	0749-3797	1873-2607		WOS:000260396600017	18929979	J	Streimikiene, Dalia; Sivickas, Gintautas					Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912			The EU sustainable energy policy indicators framework								ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL				34	8			1227	1240		10.1016/j.envint.2008.04.008				NOV 2008	2008	The article deals with indicators framework to monitor implementation of the main EU (European Union) directives and other policy documents targeting sustainable energy development. The main EU directives which have impact on sustainable energy development are directives promoting energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources, directives implementing greenhouse gas mitigation and atmospheric pollution reduction policies and other policy documents and strategies targeting energy sector. Promotion of use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements are among priorities of EU energy policy because the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements has positive impact on energy security and climate change mitigation. The framework of indicators can be developed to establish the main targets set by EU energy and environmental policies allowing to connect indicators via chain of mutual impacts and to define policies and measures necessary to achieve established targets based on assessment of their impact on the targeted indicators representing sustainable energy development aims. The article discusses the application of indicators framework for EU sustainable energy policy analysis and presents the case study of this policy tool application for Baltic States.

The greenhouse impacts of combustible fuels consist not only of combustion emissions but also of emissions from the fuel production chain and possible effects on the ecosystem carbon storages. It is important to be able to assess the combined, total effect of these different emissions and to express the results in a comprehensive way. In this study, a new concept called relative radiative forcing commitment (RRFC) is presented and applied to depict the greenhouse impact of some combustible fuels currently used in Finland. RRFC is a ratio that accounts for the energy absorbed in the Earth system due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations (production and combustion of fuel) compared to the energy released in the combustion of fuel. RRFC can also be expressed as a function of time in order to give a dynamic cumulative picture on the caused effect. Varying time horizons can be studied separately, as is the case when studying the effects of different climate policies on varying time scales. The RRFC for coal for 100 years is about 170, which means that in 100 years 170 times more energy is absorbed in the atmosphere due to the emissions of coal combustion activity than is released in combustion itself. RRFC values of the other studied fuel production chains varied from about 30 (forest residues fuel) to 190 (peat fuel) for the 100-year study period. The length of the studied time horizon had an impact on the RRFC values and, to some extent, on the relative positions of various fuels.									31	0	0	17	0	31	0	7	0364-152X			WOS:000258562100008	18521657	J	Jin HongGuang; Zhang XiLiang; Gao Lin; Yue Li; He JianKun; Cai RuiXian								Fundamental study of CO2 control technologies and policies in China								SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES E-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES				51	7			857	870		10.1007/s11431-008-0062-4				JUL 2008	2008	The technical roadmap and policies for CO2 mitigation suitable for China are a common center of attention in the fields of energy, environment, and management science in the country. Emphasizing interaction between technical research and policy research, this work discovers the potential breakthrough in the integrated field. The technical difficulties of recovering CO2 are pointed out, the mechanism of combining CO2 recovery with energy conversion is investigated, and the basic principle for integrating an environmental-friendly energy system is discussed. Moreover, the formulation of a new energy system that can recover CO2 with very low or even zero energy penalty is proposed, while the assessment methodology and model system for the technical roadmap of CO2 emission control are developed. Finally, a new technical roadmap constructing an energy network suitable for China is proposed, which may provide a new way for the development of sustainable energy and environment technologies.									10	3	0	1	0	13	1	8	1006-9321			WOS:000256523000004		J	Strengers, Bart J.; Van Minnen, Jelle G.; Eickhout, Bas								The role of carbon plantations in mitigating climate change: potentials and costs								CLIMATIC CHANGE				88	3-4			343	366		10.1007/s10584-007-9334-4				JUN 2008	2008	A methodology is presented to construct supply curves and cost-supply curves for carbon plantations based on land-use scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE 2). A sensitivity analysis for assessing which factors are most important in shaping these curves is also presented. In the IPCC SRES B2 Scenario, the carbon sequestration potential on abandoned agricultural land increases from 60 MtC/year in 2010 to 2,700 MtC/year in 2100 for prices up to 1,000 $/tC, assuming harvest when the mean annual increment decreases and assuming no environmental, economical or political barriers in the implementation-phase. Taking these barriers into consideration would reduce the potential by at least 60%. On the other hand, the potential will increase 55 to 75% if plantations on harvested timberland are considered. Taking into account land and establishment costs, the largest part of the potential up to 2025 can be supplied below 100 $/tC (In this article all dollar values are in US dollars of 1995, unless indicated otherwise.). Beyond 2050, more than 50% of the costs come to over 200 $/tC. Compared to other mitigation options, this is relative cheap. So a large part of the potential will likely be used in an overall mitigation strategy. However, since huge emission reductions are probably needed, the relative contribution of plantations will be low (around 3%). The largest source of uncertainty with respect to both potentials and costs is the growth rate of plantations compared to the natural vegetation.									45	1	0	15	0	46	0	10	0165-0009			WOS:000256476100006		J	Goldemberg, Jose; Coelho, Suani Teixeira; Guardabassi, Patricia				Guardabassi, Patricia M/K-6726-2016; Coelho, Suani Teixeira/H-7304-2012	Guardabassi, Patricia M/0000-0002-6008-2496; Coelho, Suani Teixeira/0000-0002-4587-9325			The sustainability of ethanol production from sugarcane								ENERGY POLICY				36	6			2086	2097		10.1016/j.enpol.2008.02.028				JUN 2008	2008	The rapid expansion of ethanol production from sugarcane in Brazil has raised a number of questions regarding its negative consequences and sustainability. Positive impacts are the elimination of lead compounds from gasoline and the reduction of noxious emissions. There is also the reduction of CO2 emissions, since sugarcane ethanol requires only a small amount of fossil fuels for its production, being thus a renewable fuel. These positive impacts are particularly noticeable in the air quality improvement of metropolitan areas but also in rural areas where mechanized harvesting of green cane is being introduced, eliminating the burning of sugarcane. Negative impacts such as future large-scale ethanol production from sugarcane might lead to the destruction or damage of high-biodiversity areas, deforestation, degradation or damaging of soils through the use of chemicals and soil decarbonization, water resources contamination or depletion, competition between food and fuel production decreasing food security and a worsening of labor conditions on the fields. These questions are discussed here, with the purpose of clarifying the sustainability aspects of ethanol production from sugarcane mainly in Sao Paulo State, where more than 60% of Brazil's sugarcane plantations are located and are responsible for 62% of ethanol production.

This paper examines scientific and political representations of Arctic indigenous peoples that have been central to the production and articulation of these claims. ACIA employs novel forms and strategies of representation that reflect changing conceptual models and practices of global change science and depict indigenous peoples as expert, exotic, and at-risk. These portrayals emerge alongside the growing political activism of Arctic indigenous peoples who present themselves as representatives or embodiments of climate change itself as they advocate for climate change mitigation policies. These mutually constitutive forms of representation suggest that scientific ways of seeing the global environment shape and are shaped by the public image and voice of global citizens. Likewise, the authority, credibility, and visibility of Arctic indigenous activists derive, in part, from their status as at-risk experts, a status buttressed by new scientific frameworks and methods that recognize and rely on the local experiences and knowledges of indigenous peoples. Analyses of these relationships linking scientific and political representations of Arctic climate change build upon science and technology studies (STS) scholarship on visualization, challenge conventional notions of globalization, and raise questions about power and accountability in global climate change research.									49	0	0	10	0	49	1	37	0306-3127			WOS:000257830500002	19069077	J	van Minnen, Jelle G; Strengers, Bart J; Eickhout, Bas; Swart, Rob J; Leemans, Rik				; Leemans, Rik/A-1548-2009	Swart, Rob/0000-0002-1563-1150; Leemans, Rik/0000-0002-4001-6301			Quantifying the effectiveness of climate change mitigation through forest plantations and carbon sequestration with an integrated land-use model.								Carbon balance and management				3				3	3		10.1186/1750-0680-3-3				2008 Apr 15	2008	BACKGROUND: Carbon plantations are introduced in climate change policy as an option to slow the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Here we present a methodology to evaluate the potential effectiveness of carbon plantations. The methodology explicitly considers future long-term land-use change around the world and all relevant carbon (C) fluxes, including all natural fluxes. Both issues have generally been ignored in earlier studies.RESULTS: Two different baseline scenarios up to 2100 indicate that uncertainties in future land-use change lead to a near 100% difference in estimates of carbon sequestration potentials. Moreover, social, economic and institutional barriers preventing carbon plantations in natural vegetation areas decrease the physical potential by 75-80% or more.Nevertheless, carbon plantations can still considerably contribute to slowing the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration but only in the long term. The most conservative set of assumptions lowers the increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2100 by a 27 ppm and compensates for 5-7% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions. The net sequestration up to 2020 is limited, given the short-term increased need for agricultural land in most regions and the long period needed to compensate for emissions through the establishment of the plantations. The potential is highest in the tropics, despite projections that most of the agricultural expansion will be in these regions. Plantations in high latitudes as Northern Europe and Northern Russia should only be established if the objective to sequester carbon is combined with other activities.CONCLUSION: Carbon sequestration in plantations can play an important role in mitigating the build-up of atmospheric CO2. The actual magnitude depends on natural and management factors, social barriers, and the time frame considered. In addition, there are a number of ancillary benefits for local communities and the environment. Carbon plantations are, however, particularly effective in the long term. Furthermore, plantations do not offer the ultimate solution towards stabilizing CO2 concentrations but should be part of a broader package of options with clear energy emission reduction measures.									28	0	0	11	0	28	0	9		1750-0680		MEDLINE:18412946	18412946	J	Garcia-Quijano, Juan F.; Deckmyn, Gaby; Ceulemans, Reinhart; van Orshoven, Jos; Muys, Bart				Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/F-2109-2016	Ceulemans, Reinhart J M/0000-0003-4773-9358			Scaling from stand to landscape scale of climate change mitigation by afforestation and forest management: a modeling approach								CLIMATIC CHANGE				86	3-4			397	424		10.1007/s10584-007-9297-5				FEB 2008	2008	There is a gap between the increased scientific understanding of carbon pools and fluxes at individual trees/stand and that of forested landscape with complex structures (i.e. variety of species, age classes, site characteristic and management practices). The question about how results generated from a simulated physiologically distinct individual(s)/stands grown at a particular location (scale) can be extrapolated (scaling) across a diverse population in time and space with diverse environments, has been troubling scientists for many years. Scale and scaling present three problems in common: (a) spatial heterogeneity, (b) non-linearity in response and (c) disturbance regimes. Scale, in particular, presents other three problems: (d) threshold scale for processes, (e) dominant processes with scales and (f) emerging properties of the system. Scaling presents problems with (g) feedbacks between plants and environment and (h) plant interactions. The present study proposes a modeling framework linking a process-based model SECRETS - to overcome some of the scale and scaling problems (a, b, c, d and g) - to a C accounting model GORCAM - to integrate the effects of C stock in wood products and from fossil fuel substitution. The capabilities of the modeling framework are tested against three theoretical complex forested landscapes that combine some of the five following scenarios: existing multifunctional forest under (1) actual and (2) changing environmental conditions, and afforestation of an agricultural area with (3) a new multifunctional forest or with (4) a short rotation coppice (poplar) or with (5) an agricultural crop (miscanthus) for bioenergy production. Forest reserves calculations are included for completeness of the landscape C balance and as reference. Results, on the one hand, suggest that the framework is able to simulate C sequestration and stock in ecosystem pools, wood products and fossil fuel substitution of the scenarios under actual environmental conditions. However, comparison of results under changing environmental conditions, against specific plant literature suggest SECRETS formulation must be improved with recent development in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and N balances. On the other hand, results also suggest that under actual environmental conditions, the optimum landscape scenario to sequester C and avoid fossil emissions to the atmosphere is composed by existing multifunctional forest, reserves and afforestation with short rotation coppice for bioenergy production.									4	0	0	2	0	4	1	16	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000251821600008		J	Sengupta, Nilanjan								Use of cost-effective construction technologies in India to mitigate climate change								CURRENT SCIENCE				94	1			38	43						JAN 10 2008	2008	Concentration of greenhouse gases play major role in raising the earth's temperature. Carbon dioxide, produced from burning of fossil fuels, is the principle greenhouse gas and efforts are being made at international level to reduce its emission through adoption of energy-efficient technologies. The UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992 made a significant development in this field by initiating the discussion on sustainable development under the Agenda 21. Cost-effective construction technologies can bring down the embodied energy level associated with production of building materials by lowering use of energy-consuming materials. This embodied energy is a crucial factor for sustainable construction practices and effective reduction of the same would contribute in mitigating global warming. The cost-effective construction technologies would emerge as the most acceptable case of sustainable technologies in India both in terms of cost and environment.									5	0	0	0	0	5	1	8	0011-3891			WOS:000252665400018		B	Brenna, Morris; Foiadelli, Federica; Roscia, Mariacristina; Zaninelli, Dario			IEEE		Zaninelli, Dario/0000-0002-9837-3096; Brenna, Morris/0000-0002-6929-0523; Foiadelli, Federica/0000-0002-4433-7372; roscia, mariacristina/0000-0001-9422-9508			Evaluation of Solar Collector Plant to contribute Climate Change Mitigation								2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES (ICSET), VOLS 1 AND 2								198	+		10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747001				2008	2008	The manner in which we produce and consume energy is of crucial importance to sustainable development, as energy has deep relationships with each of its three dimensions-the economy, the environment and social welfare; energy is part of many environmental problems, including climate change, and must be part of the solution. Renewable energy increases diversity of energy supplies and can replace diminishing fossil fuel resources over the long run, their use in place of fossil fuels can substantially reduce greenhouse gases and other pollutants.Growth in demand for renewable energy in industrialised countries is leading to economies of scale; such growth enables increased access by the developing world, but numerous barriers remain and the cost of renewable energy technologies remains high, although it continues to fall. The deployment of renewable energy requires appropriate economic, market and regulatory instruments and the diffusion of new renewable energy technologies into markets are particularly important. New policies need to be developed to make energy an integral part of sustainable development and Governments can employ a number of strategies to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy.In order, the paper show the cost of solar collector plant, located near Rome (Italy), in relation to the costs of operation and maintenance too, because it is necessary to give, to the decision makers, the real cost and the feasibility of the renewable technologies, to improve their use and development trough the most accurate incentives, contributed to the climate change mitigation and the achievement of thresholds production by renewable resources.

Energy and greenhouse gas metrics appropriate for the climate change mitigation goals of solar energy are discussed. Applying this methodology to SolFocus Inc. concentrator systems, preliminary results indicate that the energy payback time of SolFocus Panels can vary from 0.6 to 5 years depending on manufacturing locations. The greenhouse gas payback time, a new metric for energy technologies, varies from 1.1 to 64 years depending on the same factors indicating that greenhouse gas metrics are more sensitive to installation and supply chain decisions than energy metrics.					16th IEEE International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment16th IEEE International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment	MAY 19-21, 2008MAY 19-21, 2008	IEEE Comp Soc, TCEEIEEE Comp Soc, TCEE	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1095-2020		978-1-4244-2272-2	WOS:000258988900067		B	Yilmaz, Levent; Davis, Paul; Fishwick, Paul A.; Hu, Xiaolin; Miller, John A.; Hybinette, Maria; Oeren, Tuncer I.; Reynolds, Paul; Sarjoughian, Hessam; Tolk, Andreas			IEEE		Tolk, Andreas/0000-0002-4201-8757			PANEL DISCUSSION: WHAT MAKES GOOD RESEARCH IN MODELING AND SIMULATION: SUSTAINING THE GROWTH AND VITALITY OF THE M&S DISCIPLINE								2008 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-5								677	+						2008	2008	The aim of this panel session is to promote discussion on emergent challenges and the need for advancements in the theory, methodology, applications, education in M&S.

As a result, vehicles are a major source of urban air pollution in many cities and are the fastest-growing source of greenhouse emissions. Strategies exist to reduce both problems, but many countries emphasize one over the other rather than pursuing strategies that reduce both concerns. Using diesel as an example, this article illustrates that it is now possible not only to reduce carbon dioxide with the increased use of diesel vehicles but also to improve urban air pollution. Doing so requires both stringent emissions regulations and clean fuels. Several principles contained in the Bellagio, Memorandum are highlighted as guides for policy makers.									16	0	0	7	1	16	1	10	0163-7525	1545-2093		WOS:000255349400004	18173380	S	Smith, Kirk R.

The threats of climate change on our green planet 'Earth' demands that renewable energy share in the total energy generation and consumption should be substantially increased as a matter of urgency. India's energy development programme has been put under severe pressure with the ever-increasing demand supply gap. Due to predominance of fossil fuels in the generation mix, there are large negative environmental externalities caused by electricity generation. So it has become imperative to develop and promote alternative energy sources that can lead to sustainability of energy and environment system. Renewable electricity has become synonymous with CO2 reduction. Present communication provides a brief description about such alternative and sustained energy sources, i.e., renewable energy resources, their potential and achievements in India. Also role as important tool for climate change mitigation.									9	0	0	7	0	9	1	15	1589-1623	1785-0037		WOS:000265576500002		J	Miller, Alan S.								Financing the integration of climate change mitigation into development								CLIMATE POLICY				8	2			152	169		10.3763/cpol.2007.0432				2008	2008	The Bali Action Plan and many other authoritative recent climate reports point to expectations that additional financing will be central to future international agreements to address climate change. Several donor governments have announced commitments to contribute significant additional amounts of funding to support climate change financing in developing countries. However, the context for financing of climate change mitigation is evolving rapidly, with significant implications for climate policy. Two key changes are the dramatic improvement in access to capital in many of the most rapidly growing, large greenhouse-gas-emitting, developing nations and the increasing shift of wealth to oil-exporting countries and Asian central banks. Energy investment is fundamental to development and is capital-intensive, and access to finance is not equally available across countries and for different types of investments. Less carbon-intensive, clean energy investments frequently remain more difficult to finance, due to their smaller scale and innovative nature. Taking climate risk into account as an element of financing is potentially consistent with the investor's need to balance risks with expected returns, but the methodologies, geographical scale, and data required are not yet commensurate with the time periods and project scope typical of financing for developing countries. The policy challenge is in making the financing available commensurate with the scale and short time available for addressing climate change. Most of the likely targeted financing programmes will not be adequate for this purpose. Rather, policy makers need to focus on creating adequate signals that climate change will be an important and continuing factor in government policies for the foreseeable future in ways that will affect investor expectations of relative risk and reward. If this is done, financing will follow.

The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (COO increased from a pre-industrial level of 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005, methane (CH(4)) increased form 715 ppb to 1774 ppb, and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) increased from 270 ppb to 319 ppb, and globally averaged surface temperatures increased 0.6 + 0.2 degrees C over the 20(th) century (Alley 2007 Climate Change 2007: the Physical Science Basis. Summary for Policymakers. In IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, pp. 1-18).Stabilizing atmospheric GHG concentrations will require effort in every sector of the economy, including agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, minerals, and oil and gas. Agriculture, however, has a particularly important role to play in terms of carbon sequestration (Pew Center on Global Climate Change 1999 Agriculture's role in addressing climate change. http://www.pewclimate.org/ policy_center/ policy_reports_and_analysis/brief_agricultures. February 8, 2005; and McNaughton 2001 A Workbook on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation for Agricultural Managers. Alberta Environmental Sustainable Agriculture). Agricultural practices that offset or reduce GHGs (e.g. store carbon in plants and soil, or decrease methane and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural lands and livestock) may also have a positive impact on the quality of air, soil, water, wildlife habitats, and indeed the broader environment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2004 Environmental co-benefits of sequestration practices. http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/co-benefits.html. March 1, 2005).This paper therefore identifies agricultural practices that reduce GHGs and generate environmental and economic co-benefits.					2nd Conference on Environmental Toxicology2nd Conference on Environmental Toxicology	20082008	Wessex Inst Technol; Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Univ Granada; Dept Planning & Reg Dev; Univ ThessalyWessex Inst Technol; Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Univ Granada; Dept Planning & Reg Dev; Univ Thessaly	Granada, SPAINGranada, SPAIN	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	18	1743-3541		978-1-84564-114-6	WOS:000257704900007		B	Ali, Baharuddin; Sopian, Kamaruzzaman; Yatim, Baharudin; Othman, Mohd Yusof; Zaharim, Azami; Razali, Ahmad Mahir				Sopian, Kamaruzzaman/A-3850-2009	Sopian, Kamaruzzaman/0000-0002-4675-3927	Panagopoulos, T; Vaz, TN; Antunes, MDC		Potential for large scale solar assisted hot water heating systems for public and commercial buildings								NEW ASPECTS OF ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT, ECOSYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, PT 1		Energy and Environmental Engineering Series						188	193						2008	2008	Concerns over the impact of the environment on the massive usage of fossil fuels, combined with soaring energy prices, triggered increased interest in the use of solar energy. Solar energy is abundant, provides an important saving to the consumer, and contributes to a personal comfort without environmental damage. One of the most attractive applications of solar energy is for hot water usage in the public and commercial sector. In Malaysia, the energy bills for hot water for hospitals is huge. As case study of such facilities is the Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM)). Presently, cold water enters the calorifiers directly, which are heated by LPG boilers. Boiling time is relatively long, hence larger amount of LPG is used and much amount of greenhouse gases is released. The hot water system for the hospital is provided by a boiler with a capacity of 2.1 million kcal/hr. The fuel used is LPG. A total of eight calorifiers are used. Each calorifier has a capacity of 13,500 litre/hr. The unit is running 24 hours a day. The average solar radiation for Kuala Lumpur is 16.92 MJ/m(2)/day. The evacuated tube collectors with all the required controls system have been proposed. Simple calculations on the energy output, savings on LPG and reduction of CO, have been conducted. Prelimanary results indicated that the energy output from the solar thermal collector system was 3,180 MJ/day based on 70% collection efficiency. Saving on LPG based on proposed system was 29,000 kg/year. Reduction of CO2 based on proposed system was 64,000 kg/year. With a prospect of 100 hospitals and hotels throughout the nation, this project shall improve public awareness in energy conservation in the hot water production of their buildings and increase the market of the solar energy systems.					4th IASME/WSEAS International Conference on Energy, Environment, Ecosystems and Sustainable Development4th IASME/WSEAS International Conference on Energy, Environment, Ecosystems and Sustainable Development	JUN 11-13, 2008JUN 11-13, 2008	Univ Algarve; Taylors Port; Ctr Ciencia Viva Rigarve; Ctr Invest Sobre; Fund Calouste Gulbenkian; Delta; Alportel; Univ Algarve; Espaco Aberto; Fund Ciencia TecnolUniv Algarve; Taylors Port; Ctr Ciencia Viva Rigarve; Ctr Invest Sobre; Fund Calouste Gulbenkian; Delta; Alportel; Univ Algarve; Espaco Aberto; Fund Ciencia Tecnol	Algarve, PORTUGALAlgarve, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2			978-960-6766-71-8	WOS:000258371100030		S	Markovska, Natasa; Todorovski, Mirko; Bosevski, Tome; Pop-Jordanov, Jordan				Markovska, Natasa/G-7714-2019; Todorovski, Mirko/R-7512-2019	Markovska, Natasa/0000-0003-4598-7585; 	Barbir, F; Ulgiati, S		Cost and environmental effectiveness of the climate change mitigation measures								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION: BENEFITS, STRATEGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTING		NATO Science for Peace and Security Series C-Environmental Security						67	+		10.1007/978-1-4020-8494-2_5				2008	2008	A case study approach is applied in order to evaluate climate change mitigation measures in the energy sector in a SEE country with economy in transition. Starting point of the analyses were the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Mitigation (WG3) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Bangkok, May 2007. The applied evaluating model is GACMO, which compares each mitigation option with the baseline and determines its economic and environmental effectiveness. Almost half of the considered options are shown to be of win-win type, which can be partially explained by the high energy intensity of the national economy, although their environmental effectiveness is relatively low. On the other hand, options with the largest mitigation potential are shown to be most difficult for implementation, mainly due to the lack of financing and low prospects for attracting foreign investments, as well as legislative and administrative barriers.

The remaining GHG emissions predominantly comprise carbon dioxide (CO(2)) deriving from energy and industry sources. Proposed strategies to mitigate emissions of CH(4) and N(2)O from pastoral agriculture in New Zealand are: (1) utilising extensive and riparian afforestation of pasture to achieve CO(2) uptake (carbon sequestration); (2) management of nitrogen through budgeting and/or the use of nitrification inhibitors, and minimizing soil anoxia to reduce N(2)O emissions; and (3) utilisation of alternative waste treatment technologies to minimise emissions of CH(4). These mitigation measures have associated co-benefits and co-costs (disadvantages) for rivers, streams and lakes because they affect land use, runoff loads, and receiving water and habitat quality. Extensive afforestation results in lower specific yields (exports) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), suspended sediment (SS) and faecal matter and also has benefits for stream habitat quality by improving stream temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH regimes through greater shading, and the supply of woody debris and terrestrial food resources. Riparian afforestation does not achieve the same reductions in exports as extensive afforestation but can achieve reductions in concentrations of N, P, SS and faecal organisms. Extensive afforestation of pasture leads to reduced water yields and stream flows. Both afforestation measures produce intermittent disturbances to waterways during forestry operations (logging and thinning), resulting in sediment release from channel re-stabilisation and localised flooding, including formation of debris dams at culverts. Soil and fertiliser management benefits aquatic ecosystems by reducing N exports but the use of nitrification inhibitors, viz. dicyandiamide (DCD), to achieve this may under some circumstances impair wetland function to intercept and remove nitrate from drainage water, or even add to the overall N loading to waterways. DCD is water soluble and degrades rapidly in warm soil conditions. The recommended application rate of 10 kg DCD/ha corresponds to 6 kg N/ha and may be exceeded in warm climates. Of the N(2)O produced by agricultural systems, approximately 30% is emitted from indirect sources, which are waterways draining agriculture. It is important therefore to focus strategies for managing N inputs to agricultural systems generally to reduce inputs to wetlands and streams where these might be reduced to N(2)O. Waste management options include utilizing the CH(4) resource produced in farm waste treatment ponds as a source of energy, with conversion to CO(2) via combustion achieving a 21-fold reduction in GHG emissions. Both of these have co-benefits for waterways as a result of reduced loadings. A conceptual model derived showing the linkages between key land management practices for greenhouse gas mitigation and key waterway values and ecosystem attributes is derived to aid resource managers making decisions affecting waterways and atmospheric GHG emissions.									12	0	0	3	0	12	6	75	0273-1223			WOS:000261849800004	19092184	J	Kua, Harn Wei								Information flow and its significance in coherently integrated policymaking for promoting energy efficiency								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				41	9			3047	3054		10.1021/es060554n				MAY 1 2007	2007	Why do negative, unexpected outcomes occur in sustainable development policies? What can we learn from them? Studies have shown clearly that, to be effective, sustainable development policies must be as coherent and integrated as possible; however, policy integration should not evolve into a tool that restricts creativity and undermines the relevance of local policy initiatives. The Coherently Integrated Policymaking frameworks, based on the precept that information flow is pivotal to the success of policymaking, are proposed and then applied to design an integrated energy efficiency policy that coaddresses a set of indicators. These indicators are energy and greenhouse gas reduction, improvement of public's health, increase in material efficiency, enhancement of energy equity, provision of employment and education opportunities, improvement of workers' health, improvement of local economy, and reduction in derived costs for the business community. Our framework also provides guidance for the magnitude of change a policy should introduce at one time, guided by five distinct types of feedback loops that link the different stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, and monitoring of integrated policies.									12	0	0	3	0	12	0	6	0013-936X			WOS:000246371100009	17539503	J	Zand, All Daryabeigi; bidhendi, Gholamreza Nabi; Mikaelli, Allreza T.; Pezeshk, Hamid				Nabi Bidhendi, Gholamreza/V-4393-2018	Nabi Bidhendi, Gholamreza/0000-0001-9930-9080			The influence of deposit control additives on exhaust CO and HC emissions from gasoline engines (case study : Tehran)								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT				12	3			189	194		10.1016/j.trd.2007.01.010				MAY 2007	2007	Air pollution is the most serious environmental problem in Tehran with exhaust emissions from spark-ignition engines accounting for a major part of problem. The formation and;--tccumulation of deposits on the internal surfaces of engines could adversely affect the exhaust emission from vehicles. It is the perception that some of fuel additives can remove these deposits due to their detergency. The Iranian Department of Environment decarbonized more that 250,000 SI engine vehicles in Tehran with the goal of reducing exhaust CO and HC emissions from gasoline engine vehicles by engine deposit removal. Here, the influence of engine deposit removal by decarbonization on the exhaust CO and HC emissions from more than 500 gasoline engine vehicles is examined. It is found that the decarbonization process could reduce the exhaust CO and HC emissions, significantly. Emissions from Peykan and Pride vehicles decreased considerably after clecarbonization.

Adapting to climate change: Environmental law in a warmer world								ECOLOGY LAW QUARTERLY				34	1			61	105						2007	2007	Climate change presents a choice for public policy: mitigate our contribution to it or attempt to adapt to a changing world. In its most radical form, adaptation accepts as a given fundamental changes to our environment caused by a warming climate and consequently demands similarly fundamental adaptations in our ways of life. Those adaptations could entail widespread and severe environmental impacts, complementing and enhancing the primary environmental consequences of climate change.While environmental law has, if haltingly, moderated our environmental impacts in the recent past, this Article suggests that we should not assume that its successes will be repeated in a warmer world. Climate change threatens to exacerbate some of the problems of capacity that have limited environmental law, particularly the inability to plan comprehensively to minimize environmental effects Climate change may also undermine the public support that has been integral to the creation and sustenance of environmental law by reorienting human relationships with the natural-world. The environmental changes caused by a warming climate may convert "the environment" from an endowment to be protected to a hostile and unpredictable force to be controlled and from which we demand protection.Although pessimistic about the prospects for environmental protection in a world of unchecked climate change, the Article concludes with some optimism about our ability to avoid the worst of adaptation's consequences through a policy of climate change mitigation.									12	0	0	0	0	12	0	13	0046-1121			WOS:000246795300002		J	Tapio, Petri; Banister, David; Luukkanen, Jyrki; Vehmas, Jarmo; Willamo, Risto					Tapio, Petri/0000-0002-2226-7289; Willamo, Risto/0000-0003-3023-7378			Energy and transport in comparison: Immaterialisation dematerialisation and decarbonisation in the EU15 between 1970 and 2000								ENERGY POLICY				35	1			433	451		10.1016/j.enpol.2005.11.031				JAN 2007	2007	This article compares the development of transport and energy use with a focus on carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions in the EU15 countries between 1960 and 2000, and separately by each individual EU country between 1970 and 2000. Based on a review on the literature, immaterialisation can be defined as the reduction of energy intensity and transport intensity; dematerialisation can be defined as the reduction in carbon intensity of energy production and the carbon intensity of transport; decarbonisation can be defined as the reduction in (total and transport) carbon intensity of the whole economy. Although there is a clear pattern of reduction in energy intensity of the economy and carbon intensity of energy production, a similar pattern cannot be found in transport. Neither the transport intensity of the economy nor the carbon intensity of transport has been reduced. In particular, freight transport intensity has grown between 1985 and 2000. Data presented by country have shown even more variation. The EU15 countries were aggregated into six groups by cluster analysis to establish the different patterns on each of the three measures. It is concluded that the EU 15 countries will have problems in achieving the EU White Paper target of decoupling transport growth from economic growth and the Kyoto target of reducing total C02 emissions by 8% from the 1990 level between 2008 and 2012. However, there are some weak signals suggesting a more sustainable passenger transport system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted the economic-environmental analysis for 8 separate PV systems which have been connected to the monitoring system at the Research Institute for Energy, Environment and Economy, and accumulated real generation data on web-based database system. We show that the economics of the PV projects can be improved if 70% of the investment would be charged by the system owners and the full cost rate(for the below 30kW, 711.25 won/kWh; for the above 30kW, 677.38 won/kWh) would be warranted for the life span of the system.

The paper makes a brief introduction to the wind energy resource, current status and future prospects of wind energy in China.

About an hundred corporations are member of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the European Climate Exchange, the two functioning carbon credits trading exchanges. The United States is still the largest polluter in the world, contributing 23% of all fossil fuel emissions. Extensive literature review suggests that large U.S. corporations are slow to address the global environment challenges but a majority of them now have a clear understanding of their responsibility. Some of these corporations are actively trading carbon credits on climate exchanges. The purpose of this study is to identify environment friendly measures adopted by large U.S. corporations in their U.S. and international operations.

The school is the most important source of information and therefore crucial in raising awareness in families. Following the earth summit in 2002, UNESCO launched the decade of education for sustainable development (ESD) in 2005. Efficient use of energy, reducing environmental pollution, preserving fossil fuel resources and preventing climate change are an integral part of ESD which now forms part of the national curriculum in all European countries. The first step in realizing the energy saving potential is to inform and educate students and their families how using energy more efficiently or using renewable energy sources (RES) in the home can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent climate change. Suitable resources have therefore developed in TREAM, (4.1031/Z/02-055/2002), KITH (EIE/05/183/512.421632) European projects and CREFEN Romanian research project to be used in educating both students and their families. The emphasis has been on saving energy and the use of RES in the home whenever possible. The European KITH project ("Realising the potential for small scale renewable energy sources in the home") developed multilingual resources by the collaborative work of 17 partners from 10 European countries also accessible via Internet which explain the origins and impacts of global warming, and the necessity of clean energy houses by using set of activities together with resource material suitable for use in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. A web-based methodology has been developed which will enable families to assess how RES can be incorporated into energy efficient homes.					6th WSEAS International Conference on Education and Educational Technology6th WSEAS International Conference on Education and Educational Technology	NOV 21-23, 2007NOV 21-23, 2007	WSEASWSEAS	Venice, ITALYVenice, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			978-960-6766-16-9	WOS:000253273000018		S	Baverstock, Garry; Parker, Ian						Jennings, P; Ho, G; Mathew, K; Nayar, CV		The Master of Science in Environmental Architecture - An appropriate response to reducing greenhouse gasses								Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development in the Asia Pacific Region		AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		941				20	24						2007	2007	For the past decade, politicians have applied different shades of "green-wash" to global environmental issues in order to help juggle their positions in the political spectrum. This has created the illusion that effective measures are being pursued in the public interest for both this and future generation(s). The reality is, however, that nearly of all these initiatives are "input focused" and the various States of the Environment reports confirm that despite decades of endeavour and large financial investment there is little return on investment and that the rate of environmental degradation, particularly of the global atmosphere, continues to increase. Despite fierce posturing from the global warming sceptics, it seems that finally, the long-term data indices of global warming are being accepted seriously and politicians around the world are responding by investing public funds in the quest for options. This paper contends that with global warming the major trends will be inexorable but the manifestations complex so humans will need to embrace uncertainty and manage change. Innovation and cooperation across all disciplines and the cooperation of the entire political and social spectrum will be required to solve the ecological disasters that have already begun to unfold and accelerate in frequency. It looks from a strategic viewpoint at how specialist education can catalyse change and play an important role in managing the change. The case study used in this analysis is the RISE Master of Science Course in Environmental Architecture. It explores the implications of linking to converging interests from other emerging course streams for Engineering and other Built Environment disciplines such as Planning, Project Management and Interior design as well as socio-economic disciplines and the integrative discipline of Systems Dynamics.

At these conditions, organic materials, gases and water form a new phase, completely mixed, that provides the environment for a rapid and complete oxidation. Typical products from a SCWO process include carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic salts or acids. SCWO advantages include very high destruction efficiencies, low NOx and SOx occurrence, no dioxins or furans, totally contained process, no smokestack, relatively low temperature operation, and compact size.The chemical reactors energy integration (CREI) concept focuses on, simultaneously, the entropy generation reduction of both chemical reactor network (CRN) and heat exchanger networks (HEN) and the search for possibly new operating conditions for some of the reactors (if not all) to accomplish this goal. The basic idea of CREI is to replace each of the reactors of the CRN with a corresponding virtual heat exchanger, having the chemical reaction enthalpy as thermal load, thus creating a virtual HEN. Then, combine this VHEN and the existing HEN into an extended system, which will be the object of the pinch analysis. Care should be taken that the virtual heat exchanger system produces the same amount of entropy as the replaced chemical reactor.Pinch and CREI analysis were applied to SCWO process and the suitable network configuration and operating conditions were found to achieve the minimum entropy generation.

A key question involving the potential use of forests to store more carbon as part of climate change mitigation is the impact of forest investments on the timing and quantity of forest volumes that affect carbon storage. Using an economic optimization model, we project levels of U.S. forest volumes as indicators of carbon storage for a wide range of private forest investment scenarios. Results show that economic opportunities exist to further intensify timber management on some hectares and reduce the average timber rotation length such that the national volume of standing timber stocks could be reduced relative to projections reflecting historical trends. The national amount of timber volume is projected to increase over the next 50 yr, but then is projected to decline if private owners follow an economic optimization path, such as with more forest type conversions and shorter timber rotations. With perfect foresight, future forest investments can affect current timber harvest levels, with intertemporal linkages based on adjustments through markets. Forest investments that boost regenerated timber yields per hectare would act to enhance ecosystem services (e.g., forest carbon storage) if they are related to the rate of growth and extent of growing stock inventory.					3rd USDA Symposium on Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry3rd USDA Symposium on Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry	MAR 21-24, 2005MAR 21-24, 2005	USDAUSDA	Baltimore, MDBaltimore, MD	2	0	0	2	0	3	0	8	0047-2425			WOS:000239189900046	16825459	J	McKay, H								Environmental, economic, social and political drivers for increasing use of woodfuel as a renewable resource in Britain								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				30	4			308	315		10.1016/j.biombioe.2005.07.008				APR 2006	2006	Present woodfuel usage in Britain is negligible. Historically, Britain has been fortunate in having abundant coal, oil and gas.At an EU level, biomass is seen as an important element of energy, environment and agriculture/forestry policy. In the European context, biomass is taken to include agricultural and industrial wastes in addition to forest woodfuel, and it is regarded as a potential source of heat, fuels and electricity. In the UK, energy policy as a whole is based on four considerations-environment, energy reliability and security, affordability for the poorest in society and competitive pricing for businesses, industries and households. Within UK policy, the dominant driver for greater use of biomass as a renewable source of energy is climate change mitigation; energy security is an emerging driver; all other potential benefits of biomass as a renewable resource are of limited significance. At the moment, the UK focus is narrower than in Europe. National targets are set only for electricity generation. Furthermore, expansion of energy crops, which are defined in the major regulations as 'crops planted since 1989 and grown primarily for the purpose of being used as a fuel' and, therefore, do not include material from extant forests, is seen as the main way to ensure energy security and minimise carbon expended to transport the raw material to the point of end use. Nevertheless, woody biomass from forests, sawmills, urban areas and transportation corridors is already available in vastly greater quantities than 'energy crops'.At a regional and local scale, global environmental issues are of lower relative importance and a much wider range of potential benefits tend to be taken into consideration. For example, the economic benefits of woodfuel heating in areas without connections to the gas grid have been an important consideration in the steady increase in woodheat developments. In other areas where there is a less obvious financial driver, rural development is a powerful determinant of support for woodfuel projects. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A typical building is chosen and analysed by using the inverse auditing modelling of its energy performance. It is found that 38% of the space heat consumption could be saved by proper thermal rehabilitation measures. The entire building stock structure is then reviewed in order to assess the national potential from similar buildings. The energy savings are converted to GHG emission reduction at the energy production units, assessing thus the energy waste influence on the environment.					19th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems (ECOS 2006)19th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems (ECOS 2006)	JUL 12-14, 2006JUL 12-14, 2006	Natl Tech Univ AthensNatl Tech Univ Athens	Aghia Pelagia, GREECEAghia Pelagia, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3			978-960-87584-2-1	WOS:000245232700098		J	Liebig, MA; Morgan, JA; Reeder, JD; Ellert, BH; Gollany, HT; Schuman, GE				Liebig, Mark/A-2775-2009				Greenhouse gas contributions and mitigation potential of agricultural practices in northwestern USA and western Canada								SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH				83	1			25	52		10.1016/j.still.2005.02.008				AUG 2005	2005	Concern over human impact on the global environment has generated increased interest in quantifying agricultural contributions to greenhouse gas fluxes. As part of a research effort called GRACEnet (Greenhouse Gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement Network), this paper summarizes available information concerning management effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and methane (CH(4)) fluxes in cropland and rangeland in northwestern USA and western Canada, a region characterized by its inherently productive soils and highly variable climate. Continuous cropping under no-tillage in the region increased SOC by 0.27 +/- 0.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), which is similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate for net annual change in C stocks from improved cropland management. Soil organic C sequestration potential for rangelands was highly variable due to the diversity of plant communities, soils, and landscapes, underscoring the need for additional long-term C cycling research on rangeland. Despite high variability, grazing increased SOC by 0.16 +/- 0.12 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and converting cropland or reclaimed mineland to grass increased SOC by 0.94 +/- 0.86 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Although there was generally poor geographical coverage throughout the region with respect to estimates of N(2)O and CH(4) flux, emission of N(2)O was greatest in irrigated cropland, followed by non-irrigated cropland, and rangeland. Rangeland and non-irrigated cropland appeared to be a sink for atmospheric CH(4), but the size of this sink was difficult to determine given the few studies conducted. Researchers in the region are challenged to fill the large voids of knowledge regarding CO(2), N(2)O, and CH(4) flux from cropland and rangeland in the northwestern USA and western Canada, as well as integrate such data to determine the net effect of agricultural management on radiative forcing of the atmosphere.

This paper starts by defining, the core biogeomorphological processes-bioerosion, bioprotection and bioconstruction. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of bioconstructional forms; providing a clear definition, examples of bioconstructions, and, crucially, examining important interactions between bioconstruction and bioerosion. Three key areas where biogeomorphological research can directly contribute to the emerging field of geobiology are identified: (1) the use of biogeomorphological approaches, combined with palaeoecological investigations and predictive modelling, in the growing field of carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation; (2) providing geomorphological expertise to support the emerging field of astrobiology and (3) the potential contributions of biogeomorphology to the blossoming field of bio-geoengincering. Some key research directions and challenges for future biogeomorphological research include: exploring how biogeomorphological studies can contribute to and benefit from collaborations with other fields of geobiology, and assisting in the development of a useful, effective interdisciplinary toolbox of methods to improve quantification of geobiological processes. Importantly, suggestions are made for potentially fruitful collaborations with geomicrobiologists, geochemists and palaeoecologists. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At the individual level however, adaptation and mitigation activities are undertaken together as part of the management of risk and resources. We propose that a useful starting point to develop a national climate policy is to understand what societal response might mean in practice. First we frame the set of responses at the national policy level as a trade off between investment in the development and diffusion of new technology, and investment in encouraging and enabling society to change its behaviour and or adopt the new technology. We argue that these are the pertinent trade-offs, rather than those usually posited between climate change mitigation and adaptation. The preference for a policy response that focuses more on technological innovation rather than one that focuses on changing social behaviour will be influenced by the capacity of different societies to change their greenhouse gas emissions; by perceived vulnerability to climate impacts; and by capacity to modify social behaviour and physical environment. Starting with this complete vision of response options should enable policy makers to re-evaluate the risk environment and the set of response options available to them. From here, policy makers should consider who is responsible for making climate response decisions and when actions should be taken. Institutional arrangements dictate social and political acceptability of different policies, they structure worldviews, and they determine the provision of resources for investment in technological innovation and social change. The importance of focussing on the timing of the response is emphasised to maximise the potential for adjustments through social learning and institutional change at different policy scales. We argue that the ability to respond to climate change is both enabled and constrained by social and technological conditions. The ability of society to respond to climate change and the need for technological change for both decarbonisation and for dealing with surprise in general, are central to concepts of sustainable development.

Wood pellets are a successful example of market penetration of renewable energy in some countries in Europe, e.g., Sweden. An analysis process is proposed in this paper and used to conduct a techno-economic assessment of wood pellets production and applications in some areas in China with the consideration of technology transfer from Sweden by examining their market competitiveness with coal in these areas. Financial indices such as net present value (NPV), internal return rate (IRR) and year-to-positive cash flow are calculated to investigate the profitability of the technology transfer. Four locations of applications in China have been considered as case studies. The result indicates that in the market-only-based scenario, wood pellets production will not be profitable in all selected areas. New scenarios from the analysis process show that reducing investment and increasing the amount of bank loan will be helpful to increase the project's profitability in general; adding taxes on coal could be effective, but it depends on Chinese government's future efforts on climate change mitigation; carbon credits on wood pellets through the clean development mechanism (CDM) might make wood pellet projects profitable giving wood pellets a nich-market. The potential global environment benefits of CO2 emission reduction by using wood pellets to replace coal in a 7 MWth coal-fired industrial boiler with a thermal efficiency of 80% and 5000 hours of operation time are also presented.									10	0	0	5	0	11	0	9	1543-5075			WOS:000233977000005		J	Mestl, HES; Aunan, K; Fang, JH; Seip, HM; Skjelvik, JM; Vennemo, H								Cleaner production as climate investment-integrated assessment in Taiyuan City, China								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				13	1			57	70		10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.08.005				2005	2005	Taiyuan, one of the most polluted cities in the world, is the first cleaner production demonstration city in China. We assess energy related cleaner production projects in Taiyuan from the point of view of climate change and integrated assessment. In the assessment we develop a rather detailed methodology that relies on a battery of chained models All of the projects improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. Still, we find that their environmental health benefit differs substantially. The projects are treated similarly from point of view of funding and the regularatory process. Yet, we find that their cost differs substantially, and there is no proportionality between costs and benefits. The finding could supplement explanations of cleaner production progress that rely on financial and institutional barriers. We also ask if the positive attitude to cleaner production in China may help the country introduce greenhouse gas saving projects under another name. It turns out that some, but not all of the projects we analyse have significant greenhouse gas reduction potential. The possibility for foreign funding as CDM projects is discussed.

The SES would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions onboard.The effective realization of all functions in the SES needs appropriate human-machine interface. Throughout all the operational modes, i.e., cargo handling, mooring, berthing and navigation, an integrated interface is designed for a basically single operator on the navigation bridge to control all functions in cooperated with machine agents, hard- and software, and minimum crew. The appropriate task allocation in human operators and machine agents is proposed to make a good balance of ecology and economy, that comprises minimum and simplified automated functions by machine agents and overview displays of the agents' behavior to human operators.

Obviously, hydrogen must be produced and here we have chosen the coal gasification for its production, quantifying all the thermal and electric requirements.At first, a simple combination between hydrogen production section and power section is performed. In fact, the heat loads of the first section can be satisfied by using the various raw syngas cooling, without using some material streams taken from the power section, but also without using part of heat, available in the production section and rejected into the environment, in the power section. The final result is very poor: over 34%.Then, by using the Pinch Technology, a more efficient, even if more complex, solution can be conceived: in this case the overall efficiency is very interesting: 39%. These results are very similar to those of a combined cycle power plant, equipped with the same systems and analyzed under the same hypotheses.The final result is very important because the "clean" use of coal in new power plant types must be properly investigated: in fact coal is the most abundant and the cheapest fossil fuel available on earth; moreover, hydrogen production, by using coal, is an interesting outlook because hydrogen has the potential to become the main energy carrier in a future sustainable energy economy.

With a focus on the Australian renewable energy (RE) industry and policy situation, this paper proposes that the development of RE technologies as a response to global warming is environmentally preferable and in the long-term economic interest of Australia. However, the Australian RE sector is disadvantaged by energy market distortions and lack of policy and program support.

To mitigate greenhouse gases and other pollutants, a novel combustion process-the nonflame combustion technology with a thermal cyclic; carrier of molten salt is introduced. In this technology, a whole combustion is divided into two steps, i.e. the section of producing oxide and the section of combustion. In the first step, oxygen is,separated from air and pure N-2 is simultaneously formed which is easily recovered. In the other step, the fuels react with lattice oxygen in the oxides formed in the first step, and at the same time, thermal energy, CO2 And H2O vapor are produced. It is noted that the CO2 is easily separated from water vapor and ultimately captured. Theoretically, there are no environmental-unfriendly gases such as CO2, NOx and SO2 discharged in the whole combustion process. Some metal oxides scattered into molten salts play the roles of oxygen carriers in the combustion system, and they can constantly charge and discharge oxygen element from air to fuels during the combustion process. A nonflame combustion system with Li2CO3+K2CO3+Na2SO4 as the molten salt system, CH4 as the fuel and CuO as the catalyst was experimentally investigated. The experimental results show that the combustion process proceeded as it was theoretically analyzed, and CO2 with a high volume fraction of 77.0%-95.0% and N-2 with a high volume fraction of 91.9%-99.3% were obtained. The high concentration of CO2 is favorable for capturing and storing subsequently. Therefore, the potential of reducing CO2 emissions of-this nonflame combustion technology is huge.									6	6	0	0	0	9	0	0	1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000224627600023		J	Dartmann, J; Alex, T; Dorsch, T; Schevalje, E; Johannsen, K								Influence of decarbonisation and phosphate dosage on copper corrosion in drinking water systems								ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA				32	1			25	32		10.1002/aheh.200300516				MAY 2004	2004	The effect of softening/decarbonisation and dosage of orthophosphate on copper corrosion was studied in pipe rigs according to the German standard DIN 50931, part 1. A literature study with regard to the effects of phosphate dosing on copper corrosion has shown that on the one hand and in most of the cases a dosage of phosphate led to lower copper concentrations. On the other hand phosphate aggravated the copper corrosion in some cases. The mechanisms are not yet clear and the influence of phosphate on the corrosion of copper remains a question to be answered. Using standardised on-site corrosion tests (DIN 50931-1) with virgin copper pipes softening/decarbonisation has decreased the copper concentration. Two effects of phosphate on copper corrosion were noticed: Phosphate dosing decreased the copper oxidation and resulted in lower copper concentration in water. Likewise phosphate hindered the precipitation of cupric ions, which prolonged the existence of copper in water and resulted in a higher copper concentration. As a consequence, dosing phosphate can decrease or increase the copper corrosion, this depends on which effect is dominating.

Future growth within the chemical process industries is likely to involve even keener competition with greater impact from factors such as raw material and energy availability, climate change mitigation, sustainability, and inherent security. The future will probably see an expanded role for the systematic generation process synthesis paradigm, including an increased interdependency with process and catalytic chemistry on one hand and operability and control expertise on the other. Advances from artificial intelligence may inspire new process synthesis paradigms incorporating more effective representations of the underlying physical sciences and engineering art, new social concerns, new design strategies, and new computerized implementations. The future may also see a collaboration of the systematic generation and superstructure optimization process synthesis paradigms in which systematic generation is used to create the superstructure for simultaneous discrete and continuous variable optimization. As the resulting process designs will certainly be evaluated from additional points of view including social considerations, superstructure optimization will need to produce families of good designs for multi-criteria Pareto optimization. There are many challenges, but continued progress will be made and these challenges will be met. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last decade many countries have carried out studies related to climate change mitigation. The relevance of the outcomes of such studies depends on how well technical analysis, the priorities of the decision makers and technical/political feasibility are integrated.This paper focuses on a framework suggested by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to study the costs and impacts of national policies for abating greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. It illustrates how the quest for the inclusion of MCDA assessment in national greenhouse abatement costing studies can, without departing from the established analysis framework, be a pretext to provide a process which enhances stakeholder participation, validation, and ownership of the planning process.

The country's environmental policy considers that energy policy should take into account environmental problems and that a balance should be found between increases in energy demand are required for economic development and environmental concerns. Turkey's high rate of energy-related carbon emissions growth is expected to accelerate, with emissions climbing from 60 million tons in 2002 to almost 220 million tons in 2020. Carbon intensity in Turkey is higher than the western developed country average. Energy-intensive, inefficient industries remain under government control with soft budged constraints, contributing to undisciplined energy use. Planned industrial privatisations may close the oldest and most inefficient operations and modernize surviving ones. Elimination of energy price subsidies could stimulate energy conservation, reducing energy and emissions growth below current projections.

We can use current energy use scenarios to help us to understand how energy systems could change. Such scenarios are not an exercise in prophecy; rather they are designed to challenge our thinking in order to make better decisions today. The conventional modeling approach tends to extrapolate changes in energy consumption from historical trends; however, technology innovation sometimes causes drastic reforms in energy systems in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors. The economic aspects are another key issue to be considered in order to understand future changes in energy systems. The quantity of the energy supply is set to meet the price of the energy demand of end users. This occurs on the condition that the price of the energy supply equates with the price on the demand side under the market mechanism. This paper reviews the various issues associated with the energy-economic model and its application to national energy policies, renewable energy systems, and the global environment.

We investigated the acute lethal effect of CO, during the early developmental stages of four marine teleosts: red sea bream (Pagrus major), Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica), Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), and eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis). The percentages of larvae that hatched and survived were not affected by exposure to water with a PCO2 of 1.0 kPa (= 7.5 mmHg) within 24 h. Median lethal PCO2 values for a 360-min exposure were 1.4 kPa (cleavage), 5.1 kPa (embryo), 7.3 kPa (preflexion), 4.2 kPa (flexion), 4.6 kPa (postflexion), and 2.5 kPa (juvenile) for red sea bream; 2.4 kPa (cleavage), 4.9 kPa (embryo), 5.9 kPa (preflexion), 6.1 kPa (flexion), 4.1 kPa (postflexion), and 2.7 kPa (juvenile) for Japanese whiting; 2.8 kPa (cleavage) and > 7.0 kPa (young) for Japanese flounder; and 11.8 kPa (cleavage) for eastern little tuna. Red sea bream and Japanese whiting of all ontogenetic stages had similar susceptibilities to CO2: the most susceptible stages were cleavage and juvenile, whereas the most tolerant stages were preflexion and flexion.

In this paper, we present an integrated modeling methodology that addresses these needs. We model the dynamics of the human land-use system and of C pools contained in each ecosystem, as well as their interactions. The model is national scale, and is currently applied in a preliminary way to Costa Rica using data spanning a period of over 50 years. It combines an ecological process model, parameterized using field and other data, with an economic model, estimated using historical data to ensure a close link to actual behavior. These two models are linked so that ecological conditions affect land-use choices and vice versa. The integrated model predicts land use and its consequences for C storage for policy scenarios. These predictions can be used to create baselines, reward sequestration, and estimate the value in both environmental and economic terms of including C sequestration in tropical forests as part of the efforts to mitigate global climate change. The model can also be used to assess the benefits from costly activities to increase accuracy and thus reduce errors and their societal costs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This argument fails to consider the distorting effect of existing financial subsidies and associated incentives to fossil fuel production and consumption provided by governments in most developed countries. These subsidies support a fossil fuel energy sector that is the major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and conflict with attempts to expand the role of sustainable energy technologies. Reform of these types of subsidies has the potential to provide substantial gains in economic efficiency as well as reductions in carbon dioxide emissions-a 'no regrets' outcome for the economy and the environment. This paper examines financial subsidies to fossil fuel production and consumption in Australia and estimates the magnitude of the subsidies. Subsidies and associated incentives to fossil fuel production and consumption in Australia are similar to those in the United States and the other countries that have pushed for increased 'flexibility' during international negotiations.

Numerous economic modeling studies have confirmed the sensitivity of mid- and long-run climate change mitigation cost and benefit projections to assumptions about technology costs. In general, technical progress is considered to be a non-economic, exogenous variable in global climate change modeling. However, there is overwhelming evidence that TC is not an exogenous variable but to an important degree endogenous, induced by needs and pressures. Hence, some energy-economy-environment models treat TC as endogenous, responding to socioeconomic variables. Three main elements in models of technological innovation are: (i) corporate investment in research and development (R&D), (ii) spillovers from R&D, and (iii) technology learning, especially learning-by-doing. The incorporation of induced TC in different types of energy-environmental-economic models tends to reduce the costs of environmental policy, accelerates abatement and may lead to positive spillover and negative leakage.

These efforts are interpreted as part of a search for markets by Northern money and expertise. Highly paid professionals trained in a small number of. universities are the immediate beneficiaries of actions to be taken against the emission of specified gases into the atmosphere. Under pressure from environmental lobbies, the Bank and GEF employ a growing number of these environmental experts. Their rationale is threefold: belief in dangerous anthropogenic 'global warming',(1) calculation of monetary 'global environmental benefit', and identification of this benefit with the 'cost-effective decarbonisation' of energy supplies. Without this rationale, transfers of knowledge-intensive technology, capacity building and new forms of governance would forfeit legitimacy as well as many immediate professional gains.

FREAK has been developed for the analysis of the impact of CO2 taxes on the international trade and the global production structure. A life cycle approach has been applied for 50 petrochemical products and a broad range of emission reduction strategies have been considered. The scope of the policies has been varied (which countries apply the tax) and the policy ambition has been varied (the tax level). The results show that the regional distribution of the petrochemical production will not change significantly in case global policies are introduced. However, the regional distribution will change significantly if only a limited number of industrialised countries introduce a tax. The regional impact of such a tax depends on the carbon accounting approach for intermediate petrochemical products trade. The impacts can even be positive for the industry within the policy region. The techno-economic potential for emission mitigation is significant, even from a global perspective. The physical production volume increases threefold between 1995 and 2025. In the base case (BC) without policies, emissions increase by 65% to 970 Mt CO2 in 2025. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) policies could halve these emissions. A 20% reduction (approximately 200 Mt) can be achieved in case developing countries and oil exporting countries do not participate in emission reduction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such a process is a potential candidate for switching atmospheric carbon emissions directly to long term sequestration, thereby relieving the intermediate atmospheric burden. Given sufficient research justification, the argument is that harmful impact in both the Atmosphere and the biologically rich upper marine layer could be reduced. The paper aims to estimate the role that active intervention, through direct ocean CO2 storage, could play and to outline further research and assessment for the strategy to be a viable option for climate change mitigation. The attractiveness of direct ocean injection lies in its bypassing of the Atmosphere and upper marine region, its relative permanence, its practicability using existing technologies and its quantification, The difficulties relate to the uncertainty of some fundamental scientific issues, such as plume dynamics, lowered pH of the exposed waters and associated ecological impact, the significant energy penalty associated with the necessary engineering plant and the uncertain costs, Moreover, there are considerable uncertainties regarding related international marine law. Development of the process would require acceptance of the evidence for climate change, strict requirements for large industrial consumers of fossil fuel to reduce CO2 emissions into the Atmosphere and scientific evidence for the overall beneficial impact of ocean sequestration.

CO2-free production of hydrogen via thermocatalytic decomposition of methane (natural gas) as a viable decarbonization strategy is discussed in this paper. The technical approach is based on a single-step decomposition (pyrolysis) of methane and other hydrocarbons over carbon-based catalysts in an air/water free environment. This approach eliminates the need for water-gas shift and CO2 removal stages, required by conventional processes (e.g. methane steam reforming), which significantly simplifies the process. Clean carbon is produced as a valuable byproduct of the process. The experimental data on the catalytic activity of different carbon-based catalysts in methane decomposition reaction are presented in this work. The paper also discusses various conceptual designs for the reactor suitable for decomposition of methane with production of hydrogen-rich gas and continuous withdrawal of elemental carbon.

This paper describes how those companies with diverse commercial interests but common environmental goals came together to collaborate on solving the challenging problem of improving the economic viability of CO2 emission reduction projects.The weight of evidence suggest a link between CO2 levels in the atmosphere and rising Earth temperature. As a result, BP Amoco and other progressive energy companies are seeking ways to take responsible precautionary steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This must be done While at the same time meeting customers' needs for competitively priced products and delivering value for shareholders. Sustainable businesses want and need to be part of a solution that makes good sense for business and good sense for the environment. Governments are interested in engaging industry to voluntarily reduce their countries total emissions to comply with international Protocols, While promoting economic growth.Capture of CO2 from large combustion sources and sequestration in geologic formations will likely play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the work undertaken to-date shows that the cost Of CO2 capture is too high to make such projects economically viable. Even in the case where the captured CO2 can be used to increase oil recovery, the income generated from the additional oil production is insufficient to make these projects commercially attractive. The key is to develop new technologies which reduce the cost of capturing the CO2 and safely storing it in the ground. Knowing that Other companies were interested in these same objectives, and that governments were interested in promoting and supporting voluntary actions by industry, BP Amoco believed the best way to develop these technologies would be through a collaborative effort where costs and risks could be broadly shared.A strategic review of the technologies needed to achieve the JIP's goals identified five key areas where further development would be valuable or could lead to breakthroughs:CO2 capture by post combustion methodspre-combustion decarbonizationoxygen enriched combustion (oxyfuel)maximization of geologic sequestrationassurance of long term storageThese five areas form the core technology development program of the HP. Another key aspect of the program is the integration of the technology elements through a comprehensive economic model which will be used to evaluate and compare technologies.					5th International Conference on Greenshouse Gas Control Technologies5th International Conference on Greenshouse Gas Control Technologies	20002000	Int Energy Agcy, Australian Consortium; BHP; BP Amoco; CRIRO; Australian Greenhouse Off; Rio Tinto; Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth; Black Coal Utilisat Cooperat Res Ctr; Asea Brown Boveri; NOVEMInt Energy Agcy, Australian Consortium; BHP; BP Amoco; CRIRO; Australian Greenhouse Off; Rio Tinto; Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth; Black Coal Utilisat Cooperat Res Ctr; Asea Brown Boveri; NOVEM	CAIRNS, AUSTRALIACAIRNS, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0-643-06672-1	WOS:000184645800039		B	Windram, C						Williams, DJ; Durie, B; McMullan, P; Paulson, C; Smith, A		Are we getting our moneys worth?

The answer, categorically, is no.Of the nearly $1.3 billion in funds to be made available for climate change and climate change related initiatives under the Prime Minster's Strategy - Safeguarding the Future, the National Heritage Trust and the ANTS/Measures for a Better Environment, the majority has been funnelled into expensive mitigation strategies that achieve minimal greenhouse gas reductions at maximum cost, all at the behest of selected vested interests, most notably, regional Australia, and the natural gas and agricultural industries. In contrast, less than 10% of funds will be made available to landuse management initiatives, transport planning strategies, demand side energy management measures, and education programmes which are likely to achieve the greatest and most cost-effective emission reductions.					5th International Conference on Greenshouse Gas Control Technologies5th International Conference on Greenshouse Gas Control Technologies	20002000	Int Energy Agcy, Australian Consortium; BHP; BP Amoco; CRIRO; Australian Greenhouse Off; Rio Tinto; Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth; Black Coal Utilisat Cooperat Res Ctr; Asea Brown Boveri; NOVEMInt Energy Agcy, Australian Consortium; BHP; BP Amoco; CRIRO; Australian Greenhouse Off; Rio Tinto; Res Inst Innovat Technol Earth; Black Coal Utilisat Cooperat Res Ctr; Asea Brown Boveri; NOVEM	CAIRNS, AUSTRALIACAIRNS, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0-643-06672-1	WOS:000184645800195		J	Schnug, E; Haneklaus, S								Calcium carbonate pellets from drinking water decarbonisation as a substitute for lead in shotgun cartridges								LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE				51	1-2			1	4						2001	2001	Lead as a material for shot in cartridges for hunting or shooting shotguns has many disadvantages for human and animal health as well as for environmental quality: Metal substitutes can compensate these disadvantages only partly.

For proper and efficient use of soils and plant/animal genetic material, knowledge of the role of climate is an essential precondition. Several elements of the chapters in Agenda 21, a global plan of action agreed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), require the attention of the agrometeorologists and these have been reviewed. Three International Conventions which have a bearing on sustainable agriculture including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) were negotiated and ratified since 1992. The World Food Summit Plan of Action (WFSPA), which was developed in 1996, includes several commitments to make agricultural production sustainable. Agrometeorological aspects of these three Conventions and the WFSPA were reviewed. Some of the priorities for agrometeorologists to address sustainable agriculture in the 21st Century were discussed. These include improvement and strengthening of agrometeorological networks, development of new sources of data for operational agrometeorology, improved understanding of natural climate variability, promotion and use of seasonal to inter-annual climate forecasts, establishment and/or strengthening of early warning and monitoring systems and promotion of geographical information systems and remote sensing applications and agroecological zoning for sustainable management of farming systems, forestry and livestock. Other priorities include use of improved methods, procedures and techniques for the dissemination of agrometeorological information, development of agrometeorological adaptation strategies to climate variability and climate change, mitigation of the effects of climate change, more active applications of models for phenology, yield forecasting etc.,active promotion of tactical applications such as response farming at the field level and promoting a better understanding of the interactions between climate and biological diversity. These present important challenges and great opportunities for agrometeorologists to play a proactive role in promoting sustainable development in the 21st Century. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper reports on the first broad assessment of these direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the following socio-economic sectors in Scotland: energy supply, transport, domestic, public services, business, agriculture forestry and fisheries. The emphasis in each sector has been to detect its vulnerability to climate change impacts and climate change mitigation strategies, combined with a judgement on the confidence of prediction. This provides a comparative analysis of the sensitivity of different sectors to climate change. As such, it is the most appropriate approach for assessing and prioritising response strategies between different sectors.

However, the treatment of technology in existing models that are used to project economic and environmental futures remains highly stylized. Based on work over two decades at IIASA, we present a useful typology for technology analysis and discuss methods that can be used to analyze the impact of technological changes on the global environment, especially global warming. Our focus is energy technologies, the main source of many atmospheric environmental problems. We show that much improved treatment of technology is possible with a combination of historical analysis and new modeling techniques. In the historical record, we identify characteristic "learning rates" that allow simple quantified characterization of the improvement in cost and performance due to cumulative experience and investments. We also identify patterns, processes and timescales that typify the diffusion of new technologies in competitive markets. Technologies that are long-lived and are components of interlocking networks typically require the longest time to diffuse and co-evolve with other technologies in the network; such network effects yield high barriers to entry even for superior competitors.These simple observations allow three improvements to modeling of technological change and its consequences for global environmental change. One is that the replacement of long-lived infrastructures over time has also replaced the fuels that power the economy to yield progressively more energy per unit of carbon pollution - from coal to oil to gas. Such replacement has ''decarbonized" the global primary energy supply 0.3% per year. In contrast, most baseline projections for emissions of carbon, the chief cause of global warming, ignore this robust historical trend and show little or no decarbonization. A second improvement is that by incorporating learning curves and uncertainty into micro scale models it is possible to endogenously generate patterns of technological choice that mirror the real world. Those include S-shaped diffusion patterns and timescales of technological dynamics that are consistent with historical experience; they also include endogenous generation of "surprises" such as the appearance of radically new technologies. Third, it is possible to include learning phenomena stylistically in macro-scale models; we show that doing so can yield projections with lessened environmental impacts without necessarily incurring negative effect on the economy. Arriving on that path by the year 2100 depends on intervening actions, such as incentives to promote greater diversity in technology and lower barriers to entry for near infrastructures that could accelerate historical trends of decarbonization.

The accumulation of methane and other 'greenhouse' gases is anticipated to cause significant climate changes in the future. Ruminant livestock are the largest producers of methane in Australia and this source constitutes about 12% of the national net emissions. Australia is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, which, if it comes into force, requires limiting annual emissions during the period 2008-2012 to 8% over the 1990 value. Australian livestock emissions are projected to increase by 7% by 2010 with total Australian emissions expected to increase by 28-43%. Emissions per unit GDP are higher for the livestock sector than for most other sectors and this may negatively affect the sector if free market emission trading is implemented and no new technologies to reduce emissions cost-effectively are introduced. Using information from the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, we demonstrate that reductions in emissions per unit product are already occurring in at least one Australian livestock industry and discuss ways to ensure that similar future changes will be recorded. Cautionary notes are made regarding options of grain feeding and more intensive production, which appear to be attractive but may lead to increasing emissions when viewed on a broader basis. The potential for increased animal production with new technologies developed to reduce methane emissions suggests that there may be significant opportunities for the Australian livestock industries arising from the issue of greenhouse gas reductions. Opportunities to establish carbon sinks are also discussed. We suggest that addressing reduction of emissions per hectare rather than per head or per kilo of product results in a strong alignment with the development of more sustainable livestock industries.									31	2	0	25	1	35	0	17	0004-9409			WOS:000083087500002		J	Betts, KS								The environment								IEEE SPECTRUM				36	1			104	+		10.1109/6.738336				JAN 1999	1999										0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0018-9235			WOS:000077923100041		J	Martinot, E; Borg, N								Energy-efficient lighting programs - Experience and lessons from eight countries								ENERGY POLICY				26	14			1071	1081		10.1016/S0301-4215(98)00052-4				DEC 1998	1998	We analyze ten case studies of energy-efficient lighting programs in eight countries - Poland, Thailand, Mexico, Jamaica, Peru, Brazil, Denmark and the United Kingdom - to draw out and compare the lessons and experience related to program approaches, technology diffusion and market transformation impacts, cost effectiveness of greenhouse-gas reductions, and economic benefits. Program approaches include direct subsidies, wholesale buy-downs, bulk procurement, give-aways, education, voluntary agreements, and consumer financing mechanisms. All approaches were adequate to deliver a targeted quantity of high-efficiency lamps to consumers, but differed substantially in their cost-effectiveness, economic benefits and market transformation effects. The Poland, Thailand, Danish and UK cases in particular show that lighting programs can reduce CO2 emissions at a cost of US$5-US$10/ton, or even less including indirect impacts. The potential indirect impacts on national lighting markets through the market transformation aspects of the programs are significant but difficult to assess because of the absence of pre-project baselines. The cases focus mainly on compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for residential use, and include four recent projects financed in part by the Global Environment Facility. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Decarbonization appears as a continuous and persistent trend throughout the world, albeit occurring at very slow rates of approximately 0.3% per year. The study also discusses driving forces of the associated structural changes in energy systems such as technological change. Decarbonization also occurs at the level of energy end use and trends for final energy are shown. The quest for higher flexibility, convenience, and cleanliness of energy services demanded by consumers leads to decarbonization trends in final energy that are more pronounced than those of the upstream energy sector. The study concludes with a discussion of the implications for long-term scenarios of energy-environment interactions suggesting that decarbonization and its driving forces may still be insufficiently captured by most models and scenarios of the long-term evolution of the energy system.									33	1	0	1	2	35	0	5	0040-1625			WOS:A1996WH17300009		J	He, JK; Zhang, AL; Ye, Y								Technology options for CO2 mitigation in China								AMBIO				25	4			249	253						JUN 1996	1996	Even with changes in the industrial structure and continued improvement in energy efficiency, China's economic development and strong reliance on its indigenous coal resources will lead to large increases in its CO2 emissions in the next century. A number of technical options exist that can provide benefits to China's economic development, help protect the national environment, and also contribute to climate change mitigation. These include improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy; greater use of energy resources such as natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, and renewable energy instead of coal; and afforestation. Promotion of these options is in accord with China's strategy for sustainable development and its energy policy, which call for rational resource utilization and environmental protection.

Designing forestry projects that accomplish desired goals is no simple task however, as many past failures es attest. This paper proposes that, to be successful, climate change mitigation forestry projects need to. (a) feature other socially, economically and environmentally desireable goals as primary motivators; (b) be designed in cooperation with, and in the interests of, local populations; and (c), feature cooperative efforts between government, industry, and volunteer associations. Volunteer associations can often be assisted in being a more capable partner through an organizational training and support process, and this is one of the services offered to cooperating countries through American Forests.									1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0378-1844			WOS:A1995TK17300011		J	BONDUKI, Y; SWISHER, JN								OPTIONS FOR MITIGATING GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS IN VENEZUELA FOREST SECTOR - A GENERAL OVERVIEW								INTERCIENCIA				20	6			380	&						NOV-DEC 1995	1995	The objective of this paper is to analyze alternatives within the forest sector for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks in Venezuela. Forest clearing represents a major source of carbon emissions in the country, accounting for more than 40% of carbon dioxide and 33% of carbon monoxide emissions.The first section of the paper provides a general description of the forest resources and the forest sector in Venezuela and a brief summary of the estimated greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing. The second section presents a detailed analysis of two case studies based on ongoing forest projects, an industrial plantation and a managed protected area. Our analysis assesses the value of these two projects as mitigation options. The third section provides an overview of Venezuela's potential for conserving and sequestering carbon based on technically available land where several options could be implemented The results of the case studies are used here to provide a very rough estimate of the carbon sequestration potential at a national level, based on native forest management, plantations, agroforestry, and forestry protection. Our preliminary results indicate that forest management and forest protection might be the most promising mitigation options for Venezuela. However, given the broad scope of the study and the data uncertainties, the results of our analysis should be viewed as a first attempt to evaluate the carbon benefits derived from the adoption of such measures.									3	0	0	1	0	3	0	0	0378-1844			WOS:A1995TK17300012		J	KESSLER, J; SCHILLO, B; SHELBY, M; HASPEL, A								IS NATURAL-GAS REALLY THE ANSWER - TARGETING NATURAL-GAS IN UNITED-STATES CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION POLICY								ENERGY POLICY				22	7			623	628		10.1016/0301-4215(94)90080-9				JUL 1994	1994	Since use of natural gas emits less carbon dioxide (CO2) than other fossil fuels and CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, policies to encourage greater natural gas use are often touted as one strategy to reduce global warming. In this analysis, we examine the impacts of lower natural gas prices, brought about by government initiatives or market forces, on greenhouse gas emissions. The most surprising result of this analysis is that lower gas prices appear to have little impact on US greenhouse gas emission trends. However, lower gas prices and commensurate overall lower fossil energy costs do defer energy conservation efforts, stimulate more energy use economy-wide, and may displace cleaner renewable sources of energy. These results argue for a careful examination of attributes needed to align policy options intended to increase efficient gas use and those intended to lower overall greenhouse gas emissions.									3	0	0	2	0	3	0	0	0301-4215			WOS:A1994PF60700006		J	TREXLER, MC								MANIPULATING BIOTIC CARBON-SOURCES AND SINKS FOR CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION - CAN SCIENCE KEEP UP WITH PRACTICE								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				70	1-4			579	593		10.1007/BF01105023				OCT 1993	1993	The potential for natural C sinks to be manipulated by human means to mitigate climate change has been discussed in the environmental literature for more than a decade. There now appears to be little doubt that changes in global land-use and land management practices could significantly slow the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a result, some forward-thinking companies and governmental bodies are acting now upon the biotic mitigation literature by developing actual mitigation projects. It is now national policy in the United States to encourage such activities. The future of C offsets, however, is unclear, due in large measure to lagging scientific knowledge. Large-scale private action likely will await regulatory signals that action will be accepted as a legitimate mitigation measure, perhaps providing retroactive regulatory credit, a source of tradeable emission entitlements, or credit against yet-to-be-established C taxes. The practical potential of most biotic mitigation approaches is unknown, and the entire concept remains subject to political challenge domestically and abroad. The ability to predict C benefits of individual mitigation projects is often tenuous and subject to debate. To allow expansion of C offset practices as quickly as possible, and hopefully to fund projects with many ancillary environmental and economic benefits, policymakers and project developers desperately need physical and social science data to be provided in a useable form.

This Convention calls on countries to inventory greenhouse gases and sinks and to submit a set of national policies and measures which address climate change to the United Nations. These studies are referred to as country studies. The State of California has already completed a study on the potential impacts of climate change to the state, a greenhouse gas inventory and set of greenhouse gas reduction policies, similar to the type of analysis required by the Framework Convention on Climate Change. California Energy Commission staff have found that existing and pending California air quality and energy policies contribute significantly to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These policies are also expected to help build a stronger market for ''clean technologies'', thus benefitting the state economy and meeting an international demand for efficient, clean technologies. California accomplishments in the area of environmental policy and technology development are an example of how climate change policy, resource management and economic development efforts can be addressed collectively to achieve multiple benefits.
