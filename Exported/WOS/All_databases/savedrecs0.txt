F.; Farstad, Maja								Cultural Lock-in and Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The Case of Dairy/Beef Farmers in Norway								SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS											10.1111/soru.12277		OCT 2019			2019	Meeting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will require the implementation of effective mitigation measures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently recognised that to succeed we need to understand more about the conditions within which mitigation measures are applied, and for this, they note, we need insights from social science disciplines including sociology. We addressed this knowledge gap by using the concept of path-dependency and lock-in to explore barriers to change in dairy/beef systems in Norway. A qualitative survey of 29 farms found that changing parenting, recreational and spousal role expectations are driving farmers towards intensification (and thus higher emissions) in order to purchase milking robots, which, in turn, provide increased time for the expected role changes. Structural change is thus predominantly directed towards farm continuity which is making it increasingly difficult to meet mitigation targets in the future. The study illustrates how mitigation measures might be made more effective by understanding and addressing the broader cultural/structural environment within which farmers and their families operate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0038-0199	1467-9523		WOS:000491647400001		J	Ragosa, Giulia; Warren, Peter								Unpacking the determinants of cross-border private investment in renewable energy in developing countries								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				235				854	865		10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.06.166				OCT 20 2019	2019	Private finance has emerged as a fundamental catalyst of the clean energy transition, an urgent and necessary step that must be taken in order to avert catastrophic climate change. Yet, private investment in renewable energy, although gaining momentum, remains limited in reaching some developing countries, where it is most needed. Previous research has provided some insights into the drivers and barriers faced by investors in this sector; however, these remain understudied in the context of developing country markets. This study contributes to this body of knowledge by systematically testing the effects that a variety of factors have on foreign investment in renewable power generation in developing countries, and by investigating how these effects may vary according to the source of finance. The determinants include the implementation of domestic renewable energy policies, the provision of international public finance and the wider business environment. Using panel data covering 62 countries over a 7-year period, this analysis relied on linear and logistic fixed effects models to determine what best explains the decision to invest and the volume of foreign private capital flows in the renewable energy sector. Results suggested that the provision of international public finance, regulatory support measures and feed-in tariffs, coupled with political stability, are strong drivers of cross-border investment in renewable energy in developing countries. Finally, evidence was presented that the effects of public interventions and business environment factors on investment may vary according to the source of finance, shedding light on the importance of breaking down investment flows to fully understand private financing decisions in renewable energy.

Although long-term trends in the air or ambient temperature over China under global warming have been well studied in the literature, the changes in human-perceived wind chill conditions, especially under possible urbanization effects, are still not completely known. This paper investigates the changes of wind chill over China and quantifies the associated urbanization effect by examining nearly 2000 meteorological stations during 1961-2014 using the generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the winter wind chill temperature (WCT) in China exhibits more prominent raising trends than the air temperature, i.e., 0.623 and 0.349 degrees C per decade, respectively. The wind speed (V) and wind chill days (WCD) decreased by 0.149 m/s and 1.970 days per decade, respectively. These trends become more substantial in densely populated and highly urbanized areas such as the North China Plain. The expansion of urban built-up area induces additional warming (reducing) to the increase (decrease) in WCT (WCD). On average, an increase from 0% to 100% in the urban fraction induced 0290 +/- 0.067 degrees C higher WCT (+/- denotes the 95% confidence interval), along with a reduction in V and WCD by 0.052 +/- 0.014 m/s and 3.513 +/- 0.387 days, respectively: whereas, the presence of the grassland and forest significantly diminishes the WCT and increases the WCD and surface V. It is expected that wind chill over China tends to be weakened under glocal warming and local urbanization in the near future. Our results have important implications for climate change mitigation, urban planning, landscape design, and air pollution abatement. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Buildings, mobility, and energy systems are closely linked, and assessing their nexus by aiming for Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZENs) provides a unique chance to contribute to climate change mitigation. We conducted a life-cycle assessment of a Norwegian ZEN and designed four scenarios to test the influence of the house size, household size, and energy used and produced in the buildings as well as mobility patterns. We ran our scenarios with different levels of decarbonization of the electricity mix over a period of 60 years. Our results show the importance of the operational phases of both the buildings and mobility in the neighborhood's construction, and its decline over time induced by the decarbonization of the electricity mix. At the neighborhood end-of-life, embodied emissions then become responsible for the majority of the emissions when the electricity mix is decarbonized. The choice of functional unit is decisive, and we thus argue for the use of a primary functional unit "per neighborhood," and a second "per person." The use of a "per m(2)" functional unit is misleading as it does not give credits to the precautionary use of floor area. To best mitigate climate change, climate-positive behaviors should be combined with energy efficiency standards that incorporate embodied energy, and absolute threshold should be combined with behavioral changes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	1088-1980	1530-9290		WOS:000489349300001		J	Jin, Enze; Mendis, Gamini P.; Sutherland, John W.

In order to understand and predict the sustainability performance of cellulosic biofuel development, this study builds a system dynamics model for a biofuel system producing cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass under different scenarios. The model can simulate the dynamic behaviors of the cellulosic biofuel system and quantify its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The projected results indicate that cellulosic ethanol production is economically viable based on advanced bioconversion technologies and can provide significant benefits to the environment, such as greenhouse gas reductions and water use savings. The cellulosic ethanol industry also can make significant contributions to the bioeconomy and social benefits. This study finds that the target of cellulosic biofuels (16 billion gallons by 2022) mandated by the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program cannot be achieved within land-use change constraints, but may be achieved if there is no limitation on the conversion of pasture or cropland to energy crop land. Moreover, nitrate leaching and biodiversity change should be considered when expanding energy crops on marginal land, pasture, and cropland. This model is applicable for other complex bioenergy systems as a sustainability assessment tool and can provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders and policy makers to establish and implement favorable strategies for stimulating cellulosic biofuel development.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America											10.1073/pnas.1821674116				2019-Oct-07	2019	This century will witness a major transformation in how energy is acquired, stored, and utilized globally. The impetus for this change comes from the deep impacts that both developed and developing societies have had on our planet's environment during the past century, and the projections going forward of what will happen if we do not act transformatively within the next 2 decades. This paper describes the basis for a meeting held in October 2018 on the need for decarbonization in our energy landscape, and specifically the status and challenges of the science that provides the foundation for such technology. Within the realm of decarbonization in energy generation lies the science of solar energy conversion using new or improved photovoltaic materials and artificial photosynthesis for water splitting and other energy-storing reactions. The intimately related issue of renewable energy storage is being addressed with new strategies, materials, and approaches under current investigation and development. The need to improve the interactions between scientists working on these connected but separately considered challenges and on the transition of scientific achievement to practical application was also addressed, with specific efforts enumerated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		1091-6490		MEDLINE:31591194	31591194	J	Valderrama, Maria A.

Towards CO2 as a feedstock (Carbon Capture and Utilization - CCU)								EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL				119				445	468		10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2019.07.036				OCT 2019	2019	Plastic materials are indispensable in everyday life because of their versatility, high durability, lightness and cost effectiveness. As a consequence, worldwide plastic consumption will continue to grow from around 350 million metric tons per annum today to an estimated 1 billion metric tons per annum in 2050. For applications where polymers are applied in the environment or for applications where polymers have a bigger chance of ending up in the environment, (bio)degradable polymers need to be developed to stop endless accumulation of non degradable polymers irreversibly littering our planet.As monomers and polymers represent more than 80% of the chemical industry's total production volume, a transition from fossil feedstock today (99% of the current feedstock for polymers is fossil-based) to a significantly larger percentage of renewable feedstock in the future (carbon that is already "above the ground") will be required to meet the greenhouse gas reduction targets of the Paris Agreement ( > 80% CO2 reduction target for the European Chemical Industry sector in 2050).The combination of the predicted polymer market growth and the emergence of new feedstocks creates a fantastic opportunity for novel sustainable polymers. To replace fossil based feedstock, there are only three sustainable alternative sources: biomass, CO2 and existing plastics (via recycling). The ultimate circular feedstock would be CO2: it can be electrochemically reduced to formic acid derivatives that can subsequently be converted into useful monomers such as glycolic acid and oxalic acid. In order to assess the future potential for these polyester building blocks, we will review the current field of polyesters based on these two monomers. Representative synthesis methods, general properties, general degradation mechanisms, and recent applications will be discussed in this review. The application potential of these polyesters for a wide range of purposes, as a function of production cost, will also be assessed. It is important to note that polymers derived from CO2 do not necessarily always lead to lower net overall CO2 emissions (during production of after use, e.g. degradation in landfills). This needs to be evaluated using robust LCA's and this information is currently not available for the materials discussed in this review.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0014-3057	1873-1945		WOS:000489191900051		J	Sharifi, Ayyoob				Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013	Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613			Urban form resilience: A meso-scale analysis								CITIES				93				238	252		10.1016/j.cities.2019.05.010				OCT 2019	2019	Impacted by the compounding effects of climate change and urbanization, cities are facing a panoply of risks that threaten their sustainability. Recognizing the potentially catastrophic ramifications of inaction, local governments are increasingly involved in resilience-building activities that are informed by a vast body of research related to different socio-economic, environmental, and institutional aspects of urban planning and design. However, despite its significant impacts on growth and evolution of cities, limited research exists on how urban form can enhance resilience by increasing the abilities to plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events. As a step towards filling this gap, this paper explores how meso-scale urban form elements can affect urban resilience. This is done through synthesizing theoretical and empirical evidence reported in the literature. The focus is on morphological parameters related to the following urban form elements: neighborhoods, blocks, lots, and open spaces. Results show that existing evidence is mainly related to the associations between neighborhood density, size and configuration of open spaces, and land use mix' and resilience to 'climate change impacts', 'earthquakes', 'social issues', and 'resource scarcity'. There is also considerable evidence on the association between design of blocks/lots and resilience in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and adaptability to changing circumstances. The analysis also shows that each element influences and is influenced by other elements in the urban system and different elements should not be studied in isolation and the interplay between them should be considered. Existing evidence on conflicts is mainly related to density, but measures related to other elements may also involve conflicts. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research towards improving resilience of urban form at the meso-scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	0264-2751	1873-6084		WOS:000488142900021		J	Liu, Hongyan; Leng, Shuying; He, Canfei; Peng, Jian; Piao, Shilong; Wang, Xuejun					Liu, Hongyan/0000-0002-6721-4439; peng, jian/0000-0003-0332-0248			China's road towards sustainable development: Geography bridges science and solution								PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT				43	5			694	706		10.1177/0309133319851026				OCT 2019	2019	Seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) were put forward at the United Nations Development Summit in 2015 when releasing "Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development". However, the international community still lacks understanding of how to make a bridge between scientific research and SDGs. China has experienced 40 years of rapid economic growth and social development, which have imposed considerable challenges on sustainable development. Although many disciplines have made contributions to promoting sustainable development in China, how to bridge SDGs and scientific research is still not fully clear. In this paper, we review the contribution of geographers to this issue to provide references for further international efforts towards meeting the SDGs. We consider three aspects in particular: the sensitive process capture of regional responses and feedbacks to global change; the cognition and geographical solution of human-environment conflicts; and the mutual promotion of spatial governance and geographical practices. The contribution of geography as a discipline to the sustainable development of China is an epitome of geographers' efforts over the world. The practices experienced in China show that geography has played an irreplaceable role in promoting sustainable development, and can deal effectively with the challenges posed to the academic community by SDGs. As a discipline, geography has been deeply integrated into sustainable development. In the future, geography should become a key discipline in integrating many disciplines involved in sustainable development studies, and provide real-time decision support systems for sustainable development by combining big data and artificial intelligence.									2	0	0	0	0	2	5	5	0309-1333	1477-0296		WOS:000488692800005		J	Yu, Tai-Kuei; Lin, Feng-Yi; Kao, Kai-Yun; Chao, Cheng-Min; Yu, Tai-Yi								An innovative environmental citizen behavior model: Recycling intention as climate change mitigation strategies								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				247				499	508		10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.06.101				OCT 1 2019	2019	Climate change has been led to the increasing magnitude of frequency and severity of extreme weather, causing serious damage to overall economy of a country and individual economy of enterprises. Only relying on government subsidy to combat the impact of climate change, the work could be in vain. This study tries to use recycling action as mitigation strategies of climate change, and analyze the dominant influencing factors that affect recycling intention. This study stands in the perspective of green education in universities, regards the recycling intentions in response to climate change as pro-environmental behaviors, and revises and verifies the citizen pro-environmental behavior model. The green educations programs can communicate, promote, active and internalize the environmental citizenship through resource recycling intentions. Students learn about the importance of advocacy and activism to environmental citizenship, then generate environmentally sustainable and recycling intentions, and achieve the goal of improving the environment and mitigating to climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	16	16	0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000483635000050	31255964	J	Lien Tran; Brown, Kathryn								The importance of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers in climate change adaptation: learning from an ecosystem-based adaptation pilot in Vietnam								AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS				93	5	SI		1949	1960		10.1007/s10457-018-0302-y				OCT 2019	2019	Smallholder farmers strongly connect to their surrounding environment and depend on ecosystems for their daily subsistence and welfare. Different climate change phenomena in recent years have affected resilience of smallholder farmers in Vietnam and ecosystems where they live. The importance of ecosystem services in climate change adaptation was investigated in surveys, focus group discussions, meetings and interviews with key district and commune staff, male and female farmers of Son Tho commune in rural North Central Region of Vietnam. In conjunction with surveys an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) pilot was conducted in 2016 and 2017 with a group of 26 smallholder households. All survey respondents acknowledged that they depend on ecosystems and services for their livelihoods. Extreme weather events are predicted to increase with climate change. Smallholder farmers and ecosystems were most vulnerable to the effects of droughts and heat waves that limited supplies of clean water and impacted crop harvests, and by storms, whirlwinds and cold spells. The EbA pilot identified that all ecological patches provided direct and indirect benefits through multiple goods and services generated for provision, regulation, supporting and cultural services. The pilot demonstrated that ecosystem services supported smallholder farmers to adapt to extreme events and climate change, in particular, by mitigating the effects of droughts. Management of ecosystem services can provide joint benefits for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly where the spatial distributions of carbon, hydrological services or biodiversity are positively correlated.					15th North American Agroforestry Conference15th North American Agroforestry Conference	JUN 27-29, 2017JUN 27-29, 2017		Virginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VAVirginia Tech Univ, Blacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0	15	15	0167-4366	1572-9680		WOS:000482399600027		J	Hussain, Mudassar; Butt, Abdul Rahman; Uzma, Faiza; Ahmed, Rafay; Rehman, Abdul; Ali, Muhammad Ubaid; Ullah, Habib; Yousaf, Balal				Yousaf, Balal/M-7567-2015	Yousaf, Balal/0000-0003-2732-2176			Divisional disparities on climate change adaptation and mitigation in Punjab, Pakistan: local perceptions, vulnerabilities, and policy implications.

This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.

To identify measures that may change consumption patterns towards more plant-based foods, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the causes behind the demand for meat. In this paper we use data from 137 different countries to identify and assess factors that influence meat consumption at the national level using a cross-country multivariate regression analysis. We specify either total meat or ruminant meat as the dependent variable and we consider a broad range of potential drivers of meat consumption. The combination of explanatory variables we use is new for this type of analysis. In addition, we estimate the relative importance of the different drivers. We find that income per capita followed by rate of urbanisation are the two most important drivers of total meat consumption per capita. Income per capita and natural endowment factors are major drivers of ruminant meat consumption per capita. Other drivers are Western culture, Muslim religion, female labour participation, economic and social globalisation and meat prices. The main identified drivers of meat demand are difficult to influence through direct policy intervention. Thus, acting indirectly on consumers' preferences and consumption habits (for instance through information, education policy and increased availability of ready-made plant based products) could be of key importance for mitigating the rise of meat consumption per capita all over the world.									0	0	0	0	0	0	42	42	0195-6663	1095-8304		WOS:000477690300015	31195058	J	Kerdan, Ivan Garcia; Giarola, Sara; Hawkes, Adam				Garcia Kerdan, Ivan/F-3495-2019	Garcia Kerdan, Ivan/0000-0002-0566-555X			A novel energy systems model to explore the role of land use and reforestation in achieving carbon mitigation targets: A Brazil case study								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				232				796	821		10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.05.345				SEP 20 2019	2019	Due to its low global share of direct energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (1-2%), the implications of technological transitions in the agricultural and forestry sector on the energy system have been overlooked. This paper introduces the Agriculture and Land Use Sector module part of the ModUlar energy System Environment (MUSE), a novel energy system simulation model. The study presents a generalisable method that enables energy modellers to characterise agricultural technologies within an energy system modelling framework. Different mechanisation processes were characterised to simulate intensification/extensification transitions in the sector and its wider implications in the energy and land use system aiming at providing reliable non-energy outputs similarly to those found in dedicated land use models. Additionally, a forest growth model has been integrated to explore the role of reforestation alongside decarbonisation measures in the energy system in achieving carbon mitigation pathways. To illustrate the model's capabilities, Brazil is used as case study. Outputs suggest that by 2030 under a 2 degrees C mitigation scenario, most of Brazil agricultural production would move from 'transitional' to 'modern' practices, improving productivity and reducing deforestation rates, at the expense of higher energy and fertiliser demand. By mid-century Brazil has the potential to liberate around 24.4 Mha of agricultural land, where large-scale reforestation could have the capacity to sequester around 5.6 GtCO(2), alleviating mitigation efforts in the energy system, especially reducing carbon capture and storage technology investments in the industry and power sector.

In 2017, 77 million Nigerians or 40% of the population had no access to affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity. In practice, diesel- and petrol-fuelled back-up generators supply the vast majority of electricity in the country. In Nigeria's nationally-determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, over 60% of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions are foreseen in the power sector. The goal of this study is to identify and critically examine the pathways available to Nigeria to meet its 2030 electricity access, renewables and decarbonization goals in the power sector. Using published data and stakeholder interviews, we build three potential scenarios for electrification and growth in demand, generation and transmission capacity. The demand assumptions incorporate existing knowledge on pathways for electrification via grid extension, mini-grids and solar home systems (SHS). The supply assumptions are built upon an evaluation of the investment pipeline for generation and transmission capacity, and possible scale-up rates up to 2030. The results reveal that, in the most ambitious Green Transition scenario, Nigeria meets its electricity access goals, whereby those connected to the grid achieve a Tier 3 level of access, and those served by sustainable off-grid solutions (mini-grids and SHS) achieve Tier 2. Decarbonization pledges would be surpassed in all three scenarios but renewable energy goals would only be partly met. Fossil fuel-based back-up generation continues to play a substantial role in all scenarios. The implications and critical uncertainties of these findings are extensively discussed. Key policy insights The 2030 electricity mix for Nigeria varies across the scenarios presented, with the most ambitious scenario achieving electricity access goals and partly meeting renewable energy goals. All three scenarios surpass the decarbonization targets of Nigeria's NDC for the power sector. The transformation of the power sector relies on a wide range of financial, policy and enabling environment-related conditions taking place in the near-term, some of which are in turn strongly influenced by larger political economy realities. Fossil fuel-based back-up generation plays a substantial role in all scenarios. Data availability for this technology remains a significant source of uncertainty.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000487057600001		J	Zhao, Wei; Cheng, Yuanping; Pan, Zhejun; Wang, Kai; Liu, Shimin				Pan, Zhejun/A-3157-2011	Pan, Zhejun/0000-0002-7292-630X; Liu, Shimin/0000-0001-9612-0047; Cheng, Yuanping/0000-0001-6519-6268			Gas diffusion in coal particles: A review of mathematical models and their applications								FUEL				252				77	100		10.1016/j.fuel.2019.04.065				SEP 15 2019	2019	As key flow properties for coalbed methane production, greenhouse gas reduction through CO2 storage in coal and gas drainage to improve mining safety, knowledge of gas diffusion in coal has attracted significant interest. In the past decades, numerous efforts have been made to study the nature of gas diffusion in coal both experimentally and theoretically, and many models, including analytical and empirical models, have been proposed. However, because the assumptions, simplifications and applications of these models differ greatly, it is essential to critically review, compare and classify them for better use in practice. Therefore, this article reviews the state of the art on the gas diffusion in coal particles from the aspects of definition, mathematical models, experimental methods, and applications in environment, energy and mining safety areas. Moreover, this review article also dedicates to investigate the inter-relationships between different models, classify them into different categories and identify their limitations when they are applied in different areas. Based on these analyses, the potential research areas related to gas diffusion in coal are proposed.									4	0	0	0	0	4	50	50	0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000470113800008		J	Hipolito Leal, Patricia; Cardoso Marques, Antonio				Marques, Antonio Cardoso/D-2235-2011	Marques, Antonio Cardoso/0000-0002-9906-3874; Leal, Patricia/0000-0003-3953-4037			Are de jure and de facto globalization undermining the environment? Evidence from high and low globalized EU countries.								Journal of environmental management				250				109460	109460		10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109460				2019-Sep-11	2019	Globalization as a mechanism to connect people at distance and share knowledge has been flourishing. Simultaneously, environmental degradation has been increasing, as reflected in global warming. Through three dimensions, the economic, the social and political, and two measures, de jure and de facto, this study provides a disaggregated analysis of the effect of globalization on the critical issue of global warming for 25 European Union countries from 1990 to 2016. To emphasize globalization, the countries analysed were evaluated by two measures of globalization, de jure and de facto, resulting in their classification as high or low globalized countries de jure and de facto. Furthermore, energy consumption, economic growth and efficiency were included in an Autoregressive Distributed Lag model performed with the Driscoll-Kraay estimator. Robustness was checked using a Feasible Generalized Least Squares estimator. The results revealed that, overall, globalization increases environmental degradation, with the de jure measure having greater influence on high-globalized countries and the de facto measure having greater influence on low-globalized countries. Bearing in mind the increase in worldwide emissions driven by globalization, practices such as the relocation of polluting industries from high globalized countries should be discouraged. Incentives to harmonize global environmental restrictions could contribute to decarbonization worldwide.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		1095-8630		MEDLINE:31521038	31521038	J	Ruiz, Magdalena; Zambrana, Encarna; Fite, Rosario; Sole, Aida; Luis Tenorio, Jose; Benavente, Elena								Yield and Quality Performance of Traditional and Improved Bread and Durum Wheat Varieties under Two Conservation Tillage Systems								SUSTAINABILITY				11	17						10.3390/su11174522				SEP 1 2019	2019	The increasing spread of conservation agriculture demands that the next generation of wheat varieties includes cultivars capable of maintaining satisfactory yields with lower inputs and under uncertain climate scenarios. On the basis of the genetic gains achieved during decades of selection oriented to yield improvements under conventional crop management, it is important that novel breeding targets are defined and addressed. Grain yield, yield-related traits, and phenological and morphological characteristics, as well as functional quality parameters have been analyzed for six varieties each of bread and durum wheat, under minimum tillage and no-tillage. During the three-year experiment, the climatic conditions at the field trial site were characterized by low rainfall, although different degrees of aridity-from moderate to severe-were experienced. Differences were found between these two soil management practices in regard to the varieties' yield stability. A positive influence of no-tillage on traits related to grain and biomass yield was also evidenced, and some traits among the examined seemed involved in varietal adaptation to a particular non-conventional tillage system. The study also confirmed some breeding targets for improved performance of wheat genotypes in conservation agroecosystems. These traits were represented in the small set of traditional varieties analysed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0		2071-1050		WOS:000486877700011		J	Kenfack, Chrislain Eric								Just Transition at the Intersection of Labour and Climate Justice Movements: Lessons from the Portuguese Climate Jobs Campaign								GLOBAL LABOUR JOURNAL				10	3			224	239						SEP 2019	2019	In the current context of climate change and its accompanying adverse effects on natural, human and social systems, the imperative of transitioning to low- and preferably post-carbon societies has become a non-negotiable reality if we want to avoid reaching the point of no return in terms of environmental and climate catastrophe. Such a transition requires that the interests and needs of workers and their communities be taken into consideration to make sure they do not bear the heaviest part of the burden in terms of loss of jobs and means of survival, and that they are prepared to face the new, post-carbon labour environment. The concept of Just Transition was coined to describe both the socio-political project put forward by trade unions in response to climate change, and the recognition by climate activists that the livelihoods and security of workers and their communities must be ensured during the transition to a post-carbon society. However, just transition movements are divided between two quite different orientations, which are labelled "affirmative" and "transformative." On the one hand, affirmative just transition advocates envisage a transition within the current political-economic system. Transformative just transition activists, on the other hand, envisage a post-capitalist transition. This article, drawing upon an extensive case study of the Portuguese climate jobs campaign, goes beyond showing how these orientations shape the positions taken by union and climate activists. The article also analyses how the conflicts and cooperation between these key actors can shed light on the possibilities and/or limitations of just transition as a framework for the collective action needed to achieve rapid, deep decarbonisation of economies in the Global North context.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1918-6711			WOS:000488302300005		J	Bardhan, Ronita; Debnath, Ramit; Jana, Arnab				; Jana, Arnab/C-4116-2016	Bardhan, Ronita/0000-0001-5336-4084; Jana, Arnab/0000-0001-8210-1566			Evolution of sustainable energy policies in India since 1947: A review								WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT				8	5					e340	10.1002/wene.340				SEP 2019	2019	India's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions in 2015 toward the Two-Degree Celsius climate change goal has endorsed 15% of renewable integration in the primary energy mix by 2020. The energy space is strategy to meet the target without affecting its immediate sustainable development goals. This study documents this strategic effort by tracking the historical trajectory of energy policy planning since its independence in 1947. An objective ontological approach was adopted in reviewing the evolution of energy policy into five distinct phases. Phase I (1947-1970), focused on supply adequacy with the overall thrust on infrastructure development as the pillar of Indian economy. In Phase II (the 1970s) the focus shifted in addressing the energy access crisis. Phase III (the 1980s) was based on increment, diversification, and streamlining on supplies for energy security purposes. Phase IV (the 1990s) is the period of modernization of the overall Indian electricity system. Phase V (the 2000s) is the present phase of market transformation and climate change mitigation energy policies. A co-assessment of India's policy to the international climate negotiations showed that India remained responsive to international climate goals. It became reactive in the planning for sustainable energy policy after its ratification of Kyoto Protocol in 2001. Since then, India has been instrumental in administering strict emission reduction norms and efficiency measures. This review concludes that the country needs to upgrade its inefficient transmission and distribution networks, which was broadly neglected. The subsidy allocations in domestic energy resources should be well-adjusted without compromising on its social costs.

These emissions could be reduced by replacing inefficient or fossil-fueled equipment with efficient electric heat pumps. Recent research has shown that variable-speed heat pumps (VSHPs) could also provide a variety of power system services, such as price- or carbon-based load shifting, peak demand reduction, emergency demand response, and frequency regulation. By providing some or all of these services, VSHPs could facilitate the integration of wind and solar power into the grid, accelerating decarbonization of other economic sectors. However, the provision of power system services poses new and challenging VSHP control problems. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising approach to these problems. MPC combines weather and load predictions, online optimization, and a mathematical model of a VSHP's performance under varying ambient conditions. With few exceptions, existing VSHP models neglect two important features that arise in practice: (1) dependence of efficiency and capacity on compressor speed and indoor and outdoor temperatures, and (2) inability of VSHPs to operate at low compressor speeds. In this paper, we develop a new VSHP control model that considers both features. The model expresses the VSHP's power consumption and heat production as affine functions of the driving temperatures and compressor speed. The model also includes a binary variable that constrains the VSHP to be either turned off, or operating within a range of acceptable compressor speeds using mixed-integer programming (MIP). This VSHP model and optimization strategy is combined with neural network based heat load prediction in MPC simulations. These simulations suggest that this approach could reduce energy costs by 9-22% and carbon emissions by up to 22%, relative to MPC with existing VSHP models. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Existing research related to fertilizer use efficiency has focused on grain crops, and few studies have considered cash crops despite the significant structural shift of fertilizer application from grain to cash crops and the impacts of climate factors on fertilizer use efficiency. This paper employed a stochastic frontier method to examine the technical efficiency and fertilizer use efficiency of apple production by adopting panel data of eight major apple production provinces in China from 1992 to 2014. Further, the panel random-effects Tobit model was used to explore the factors influencing fertilizer use efficiency. The fertilizer use efficiency score ranged within 0.002-0.878, with a mean value of 0.472, which was much lower and had greater variability than technical efficiency with an average value of 0.868. Irrigation fees, land size, non-agricultural employment opportunities, apple planting area ratio and fertilizer prices had significant positive effects on fertilizer use efficiency in apple production. Disaster ratio, precipitation, sunshine hours, and apple prices had a significant negative effect on fertilizer use efficiency. Formula fertilizer promoted by governments had no significant effect on improving fertilizer use efficiency. Fertilizer use efficiencies are more sensitive to education level and fertilizer price than non-agricultural employment opportunity and land size, and it is weakly sensitive to climate factors, apple price, and apple planting area ratio. Policies aimed at improving fertilizer use efficiency and reducing environment pollution should, therefore, focus on promoting non-agricultural employment opportunities and land circulation, strengthening and expanding rural extension services, raising environmental protection awareness and controlling fertilizer price, and encouraging farmers to adopt new production technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	45	45	1470-160X	1872-7034		WOS:000470966000027		J	Hawkins, Irana W.; Mangels, A.

Dietetics Program Directors in the United States Support Teaching Vegetarian and Vegan Nutrition and Half Connect Vegetarian and Vegan Diets to Environmental Impact								FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION				6						123	10.3389/fnut.2019.00123				AUG 14 2019	2019	Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) are clinicians trained in the application of food, nutrition, and dietetics. Vegetarians and vegans have a lower risk of many nutrition-related chronic diseases that are epidemic while vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with reduced environmental impact. Despite this strong diet-disease and diet-environment connection, it is not known if dietetics students are taught the principles of vegetarian and vegan nutrition. The overarching goal of our study was to investigate curricular practices in accredited dietetics training programs in the United States (U.S.) including (1) the prevalence and perceived importance of vegetarian and vegan nutrition instruction and (2) if program directors connect vegetarian and vegan diets to climate change mitigation and resource conservation. Primary data were collected by way of a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey. All Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) program directors in the U.S. (N = 574) were sent a 37-question survey and invited to participate in the study. Outcome measures included the prevalence of vegetarian and vegan nutrition instruction, quantifying if relationships exist among variables, and the frequency of connecting vegetarian and vegan diets to environmental impact. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized. Respondents (n = 205) indicated that over 51% of programs teach vegetarian nutrition while 49% teach vegan nutrition. There were significant differences between program type and the prevalence of vegetarian (p = 0.00005) and vegan (p = 0.00005) nutrition instruction. Over 90% of program directors believe that vegetarian and vegan nutrition should be taught. Over 50% of programs identify the connection between vegetarian and vegan diets in climate change mitigation and resource conservation. Most ACEND program directors believe vegetarian and vegan nutrition should be taught and half connect diet to environmental concern. Nevertheless, there is a discrepancy between beliefs and practice behaviors. These results suggest the need for increased collaboration and the use of novel techniques that better incorporate vegan and vegetarian nutrition throughout dietetics education.									0	0	0	0	0	0	11	11	2296-861X			WOS:000481511500001	31475150	J	Charalampidis, Ioannis; Karkatsoulis, Panagiotis; Capros, Pantelis								A Regional Economy-Energy-Transport Model of the EU for Assessing Decarbonization in Transport								ENERGIES				12	16					3128	10.3390/en12163128				AUG 2 2019	2019	The EU decarbonization strategy foresees deep cuts in CO2 in the transport sector. Investment in infrastructure, manufacturing of new technology vehicles and production of alternative fuels induce macroeconomic changes in activity and employment for both national and regional economies. The objective of the paper is to present a newly built macroeconomic-regional model (GEM-E3-R general equilibrium model for economy, energy and environment for regions) for assessing impacts of transport sector restructuring on regional economies of the entire EU, segmented following NUTS-3 (nomenclature of territorial units of statistics). The model combines general economic equilibrium theory with location choice and New Economic Geography and implements a dynamic, fully endogenous agglomeration-dispersion mechanism for people and industries coupled with a gravity model for bilateral interregional flows. A novelty of the model is a two-layers structure: (i) the country-wide layer formulated as a global multi-sector, multi-country and multi-period computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; and (ii) the regional economy layer, which simulates impacts on regional economies, while considering country-wide economic trends as boundary conditions. The paper presents a use of the model in the assessment of regional economic effects of electrification of car mobility in Europe and wide use of domestically produced advanced biofuels.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1		1996-1073		WOS:000484454000091		J	Bakker, Stefan; Haq, Gary; Peet, Karl; Gota, Sudhir; Medimorec, Nikola; Yiu, Alice; Jennings, Gail; Rogers, John								Low-Carbon Quick Wins: Integrating Short-Term Sustainable Transport Options in Climate Policy in Low-Income Countries								SUSTAINABILITY				11	16					4369	10.3390/su11164369				AUG 2019	2019	In low income countries (LICs) in Africa and Asia per capita transport greenhouse gas emissions are relatively low but are expected to grow. Therefore, a substantial reduction in projected increases is required to bring emissions in line with long-term global climate objectives. Literature on how LICs are integrating climate change mitigation and sustainable transport strategies is limited. Key drivers of transport policy include improving accessibility, congestion, air quality, energy security, with reducing greenhouse gas emissions being of lower priority. This paper assesses the current status, feasibility and potential of selected low-carbon transport measures with high sustainable development benefits that can be implemented in the short to medium term, so- called 'quick wins'. It examines to what extent ten such quick wins are integrated in climate change strategies in nine low- and middle-income countries in Africa and South Asia. The research method comprises expert interviews, an online questionnaire survey of experts and policymakers in the focus countries, and a review of literature and government plans. Results indicate that sustainable urban transport policies and measures are considered high priority, with vehicle-related measures such as fuel quality and fuel economy standards and electric two- and three-wheelers being of key relevance. In existing national climate change strategies, these quick wins are integrated to a certain extent; however, with better coordination between transport and energy and environment agencies such strategies can be improved. A general conclusion of this paper is that for LICs, quick wins can connect a top-down' climate perspective with a 'bottom-up' transport sector perspective. A knowledge gap exists as to the mitigation potential and sustainable development benefits of these quick wins in the local context of LICs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1		2071-1050		WOS:000484472500113		J	Doukalianou, F.; Radoglou, K.; Agnelli, A.

Annual Greenhouse-Gas Emissions from Forest Soil of a Peri-Urban Conifer Forest in Greece under Different Thinning Intensities and Their Climate-Change Mitigation Potential								FOREST SCIENCE				65	4			387	400		10.1093/forsci/fxy069				AUG 2019	2019	Knowledge of the response of thinning implementation on forest soil-atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) (CO2, CH4, N2O) fluxes exchange system in Mediterranean region is limited because of the high heterogeneity of both soil properties and forest biomass. The novelty of this study is grounded predominantly in evaluating for the first time the response of annual GHG fluxes to thinning in a coniferous peri-urban forest soil in Greece, thus contributing significantly to the enrichment of the GHG fluxes database from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. Results suggest that CH4 uptake increased with increasing thinning intensity. The reduction in CO2 emissions in both thinning treatments was possibly related to an indirect effect of soil heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration. Coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece can act temporally as sinks of atmospheric N2O in the coldest months and a weak source of N2O fluxes in summer. The GHG variation depended largely on soil environmental factors with soil temperature representing the dominant factor for CO(2 )and CH4, whereas soil moisture correlated, albeit weakly, with N2O variability. Reduction in global warming potential was observed in both thinning treatments, markedly in selective treatment, giving an initial indication that high-intensity thinning in coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece presents a high potential for global change mitigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	8	8	0015-749X	1938-3738		WOS:000482774200003		J	Baldaev, Lev Kh; Khamitsev, Boris G.; Baldaev, Sergey L.; Prokofiev, Mikhail, V								THE FEATURES OF DETONATION SPRAYING TECHNOLOGY FOR TUNGSTEN CARBIDE BASED COATINGS								PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA				16	32			739	754						AUG 2019	2019	The authors studied the effect of key parameters of detonation spraying process on tungsten carbide-based coatings and their mechanical properties, microstructure, and phase composition. Two main tasks are solved when developing the technology for spraying the carbide-containing materials. The relationship is established between the phase composition of tungsten-based coatings and their strength, hardness, and substrate adhesion. It was established that the WC dissolution in the metal phase promotes the increase of substrate adhesion as well as strength and hardness of coating material. A procedure of spraying coatings in the reduction mode is proposed: i.e., using working gas mixtures with excess acetylene. It prevents the decarbonization of WC carbides under the action of detonation products and environment. The phase composition heterogeneity (both along with the layer thickness and along the spraying spot diameter) is established. This depends on a complex of factors that determine the intensity of heat removal from the area of layer formation. For optimizing the structure and the mechanical characteristics of the coating, we need to control decarbonization of carbide component (WC) and formation of alpha-Ni (W) solid solution at different stages of spraying. Even a minor departure from carbon content leads to either appearance of graphite or formation the fragile eta'-phase (Co3W3C), thus strongly reducing the mechanical properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1806-0374	2179-0302		WOS:000482205600067		J	Choon, Shay-Wei; Ong, Hway-Boon; Tan, Siow-Hooi								Does risk perception limit the climate change mitigation behaviors?

With climate change, adverse human health effects caused by heat exposure are of increasing public health concern. Forests provide beneficial ecosystem services for human health, including local cooling. Few studies have assessed the relationship between deforestation and heat-related health effects in tropical, rural populations. We sought to determine whether deforested compared to forested landscapes are associated with increased physiological heat strain in a rural, tropical environment. Methods. We analyzed data from 363 healthy adult participants from ten villages who participated in a two-by-two factorial, randomized study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia from 10/1/17 to 11/6/17. Using simple randomization, field staff allocated participants equally to different conditions to conduct a 90 min outdoor activity, representative of typical work. Core body temperature (CBT) was estimated at each minute during the activity using a validated algorithm from baseline oral temperatures and sequential heart rate data, measured using chest band monitors. We used linear regression models, clustered by village and with a sandwich variance estimator, to assess the association between deforested versus forested conditions and the number of minutes each participant spent above an estimated CBT threshold of 38.5 degrees C. Results. Compared to those in the forested condition (n = 172), participants in the deforested condition (n = 159) spent an average of 3.08 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57, 5.60) additional minutes with an estimated CBT exceeding 38.5 degrees C, after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and experiment start time, with a larger difference among those who began the experiment after 12 noon (5.17 [95% CI 2.20, 8.15]). Conclusions. In this experimental study in a tropical, rural setting, activity in a deforested versus a forested setting was associated with increased objectively measured heat strain. Longer durations of hyperthermia can increase the risk of serious health outcomes. Land use decisions should consider the implications of deforestation on local heat exposure and health as well as on forest services, including carbon storage functions that impact climate change mitigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	7	7	1748-9326			WOS:000478753400004	31485260	J	Pierer, Carl; Creutzig, Felix				Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016	Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348			Star-shaped cities alleviate trade-off between climate change mitigation and adaptation								ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS				14	8					085011	10.1088/1748-9326/ab2081				AUG 2019	2019	To deal with climate change, cities must reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and at the same time mitigate climate impacts associated with the physical infrastructure of the built environment. One strand of literature demonstrates that compact cities of sufficient density result in lower GHG emissions in the transport and the buildings sectors compared to sprawled cities. Another strand of literature, however, reveals that compactness hinders climate adaptation by amplifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. As a result, mitigation and adaptation objectives of cities appear to contradict each other. Here, we develop a geometrical optimization framework and model of a three-dimensional city that minimizes this conflict. It makes use of the observation that low-carbon efficient transport can be realized via linear public transport axes, and that GHG emissions and UHI effects scale differently with varying geometric properties, thus enabling design that reflects both the economics and the climate of cities. We find that star-shaped cities, in contrast to radially symmetric cities, are well suited to alleviate the problematic trade-off. We also demonstrate that urban design considerations depend on transport fuel prices. The results are of particular importance for city planners of rapidly urbanizing cities in Asia and Africa who still have the potential to shape urban layout.									0	0	0	0	0	0	8	8	1748-9326			WOS:000478679300003		J	Mathew, Isack; Shimelis, Hussein; Mutema, Macdex; Clulow, Alistair; Zengeni, Rebecca; Mbava, Nozibusiso; Chaplot, Vincent					Clulow, Alistair/0000-0001-8803-8780; Mutema, Macdex/0000-0002-6150-6895			Selection of wheat genotypes for biomass allocation to improve drought tolerance and carbon sequestration into soils								JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE				205	4			385	400		10.1111/jac.12332				AUG 2019	2019	The biomass allocation pattern of plants to shoots and roots is a key in the cycle of elements such as carbon, water and nutrients with, for instance, the greatest allocations to roots fostering the transfer of atmospheric carbon to soils through photosynthesis. Several studies have investigated the root to shoot ratio (R:S) biomass of existing crops but variation within a crop species constitutes an important information gap for selecting genotypes aiming for increasing soil carbon stocks for climate change mitigation and food security. The objectives of this study were to evaluate agronomic performance and quantify biomass production and allocation between roots and shoots, in response to different soil water levels to select promising genotypes for breeding. Field and greenhouse experiments were carried out using 100 genotypes including wheat and Triticale under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. The experiments were set-up using a 10 x 10 alpha lattice design with two replications under water stress and non-stress conditions. The following phenotypic traits were collected: number of days to heading (DTH), number of productive tillers per plant (NPT), plant height (PH), days to maturity (DTM), spike length (SL), kernels per spike (KPS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), root biomass (RB), shoot biomass (SB), root to shoot ratio (R:S) and grain yield (GY). There was significant (p < 0.05) variation for grain yield and biomass production because of genotypic variation. The highest grain yield of 247.3 g/m(2) was recorded in the genotype LM52 and the least was in genotype Sossognon with 30 g/m(2). Shoot biomass ranged from 830 g/m(2) (genotype Arenza) to 437 g/m(2) (LM57), whilst root biomass ranged between 603 g/m(2) for Triticale and 140 g/m(2) for LM15 across testing sites and water regimes. Triticale also recorded the highest R:S of 1.2, whilst the least was 0.30 for wheat genotype LM18. Overall, drought stress reduced total biomass production by 35% and R:S by 14%. Genotypic variation existed for all measured traits useful for improving drought tolerance, whilst the calculated R:S values can improve accuracy in estimating C sequestration potential of wheat. Wheat genotypes LM26, LM47, BW140, LM70, LM48, BW152, LM75, BW162, LM71 and BW141 were selected for further development based on their high total biomass production, grain yield potential and genetic diversity under drought stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	8	8	0931-2250	1439-037X		WOS:000475618900004		J	Pollitt, Michael G.

We discuss how national electricity markets and cross-border electricity markets have been reshaped by the process. We examine the Commission's own work on evaluating the benefits of the single market. We look at the wider evidence of impact on prices, security of supply, the environment, and innovation. We conclude that the institutional changes are extensive and there has been significant market harmonisation and integration. However, the measured benefits are difficult to identify, but likely to be small. This is partly because over the same period there has been a large rise in subsidised renewable generation that is driven by the decarbonisation agenda.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0889-938X	1573-7160		WOS:000475586500005		J	Cuellar-Martinez, Tomasa; Carolina Ruiz-Fernandez, Ana; Sanchez-Cabeza, Joan-Albert; Perez-Bernal, Libia-Hascibe; Sandoval-Gil, Jose					Cuellar Martinez, Tomasa del Carmen/0000-0002-0460-6275			Relevance of carbon burial and storage in two contrasting blue carbon ecosystems of a north-east Pacific coastal lagoon								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				675				581	593		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.388				JUL 20 2019	2019	Coastal vegetated ecosystems constitute very productive habitats, characterized by efficient C-org sequestration and long-term preservation in sediments, so they play an important role in climate change mitigation. The temporal evolution of C-org content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico) by using Pb-210-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01-0.03 g cm(-2) yr(-1)) than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02-3.21 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The C-org stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2-53.6 Mg ha(-1) at 10 cm depth; 259-320 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth) than in seagrass cores (5.7-14.4 Mg ha(-1), and 80-98, Mg ha(-1), respectively), whereas C-org burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13-60 g m(-2) yr(-1)) than in seagrass (9-144 g m(-2) yr(-1)) habitats, and the temporal variations observed in C-org burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall C-org stock (485 +/- 51 Gg C) for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby. Our results highlight the need to protect these environments as relevant carbon reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is a lack of knowledge of adaptation strategies that would be able to reduce the impacts of extreme heat to cope with an uncertain future, especially on the local scale. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of adaptation strategies to reduce the mortality risk under two climate change mitigation scenarios, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. We selected four street-level adaptation strategies: Green walls, sidewalk greenways, reduced-albedo sidewalks and street trees. As an extreme heat assessment criterion, we used a pedestrian mean radiant temperature threshold, which was strongly related to heat mortality. The results, projected to the 2050s, showed that green walls, greenways and reduced-albedo sidewalks could adequately reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP2.6; however, only street trees could reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP8.5 in the 2050s. This implies that required adaptation strategies can vary depending on the targeted scenario. This study was conducted using one street in Seoul, but the methodology can be expanded to include other adaptation strategies, and applied to various locations to help stakeholders decide on effective adaptation options and make local climate change adaptation plans.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2		2071-1050		WOS:000482261800046		J	Ba, Yuhao; Galik, Christopher					Ba, Yuhao/0000-0002-4148-2494			Polycentric Systems and Multiscale Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in the Built Environment(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave								REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH				36	4			473	496		10.1111/ropr.12342				JUL 2019	2019	Addressing climate change requires consideration of mitigation and adaptation opportunities at multiple spatial scales. This is particularly true in the built environment, defined here to include individual buildings, neighborhoods, and the spaces between. The current U.S. political environment portends fewer resources and coordinating services for mitigation and adaptation at the federal level, however, reinforcing the relevance and necessity of actions at subnational levels. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of a polycentric model of governance to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation practices, as well as the presence of polycentric systems in the built environment. We assemble a database of practices with the potential to achieve both mitigation and adaptation objectives, as well as those that may be cross-purposed or that may achieve one but not the other. We review practices to gauge the applicability of a polycentric model of governance to mitigation and adaptation practices in the built environment, and examine the attributes of three existing adaptation and/or mitigation programs to assess the extent to which they exhibit polycentric attributes. We conclude with recommendations for a broader research agenda, including efforts to develop more in-depth examinations into individual programs and comparative analysis of performances of different governance attributes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1541-132X	1541-1338		WOS:000474935900003		J	Saravia-Matus, Silvia L.; Aguirre Hormann, Pablo; Berdegue, Julio A.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				102				338	348		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.02.050				JUL 2019	2019	The paper explores the relationship between production and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the agricultural sector of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) between 1990 and 2015. By appraising how GHG emissions have changed with respect to agricultural production (elasticity), we are able to classify countries into six decoupling states. While the decoupling elasticity provides information for assessing the evolution within countries, we introduce a performance ratio for country comparison by calculating GHG emissions over agricultural production for 2015 and using the global distribution as benchmark. The information from both measurements serves to identify various country and sub regional situations. The findings illustrate that countries with performance ratios in the top 25% and under the best-case elasticity scenario (of strong decoupling) are not necessarily the same as the ones usually identified under factor productivity analyses, suggesting that environment-specific policy incentives and tools play a key role in enhancing sustainable agricultural production. Another major finding is that very few countries in the region (and worldwide) are able to offset agriculture emissions with land use-related carbon sequestration practices. Lastly, the evidence on small Caribbean island-states reporting the worst-case elasticity scenario (of strong negative decoupling) and performance ratios close to the world median, further supports the need for development plans related to climate change mitigation and adaptation in this sub region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	7	7	1470-160X	1872-7034		WOS:000470964500033		J	El-Naggar, Ali; El-Naggar, Ahmed Hamdy; Shaheen, Sabry M.; Sarkar, Binoy; Chang, Scott X.; Tsang, Daniel C.

Biochar can act as a source of nutrients and sequester carbon (C) in the soil. The nutrient release capacity of biochar once applied to the soil varies with the composition of the biochar, which is a function of the feedstock type and pyrolysis condition used for biochar production. Biochar has a crucial influence on soil C mineralization, including its positive or negative priming of microorganisms involved in soil C cycling. However, in various cases, biochar application to the soil may cause negative effects in the soil and the wider environment. For instance, biochar may suppress soil nutrient availability and crop productivity due to the reduction in plant nutrient uptake or reduction in soil C mineralization. Biochar application may also negatively affect environmental quality and human health because of harmful compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofurans (PCDD/DF). In this review, we discuss the linkage between biochar composition and function, evaluate the role biochar plays in soil fertility improvement and C sequestration, and discuss regulations and concerns regarding biochar's negative environmental impact. We also summarize advancements in biochar production technologies and discuss future challenges and priorities in biochar research.									2	0	0	2	0	2	78	80	0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000469896300046	31027831	J	Frade, Pedro M.

Thus, many economies that share concerns about climate change, invest in renewable sources to help contain the global warming. However, the massive integration of these renewable sources, which brings more intermittency and volatility, together with the natural variation of consumption, pose greater challenges that should be mitigated with adequate tools, as offered by a liberalized and organized electrical market. To help cost reduction in a market environment, the coordination between different Transmission System Operators (TSOs) is of utmost importance. The objective of this work is to provide a framework analysis for the sharing of ancillary services (AS) in the context of the Iberian ES, in particular a techno-economic analysis for the secondary reserve (SR) control. The SR control is fundamental to correct load variations and help stabilize the ES where the TSOs are inserted. To this end, the main goal is to control the regional imbalance of the Iberian Peninsula, in a coordinated way, with a minimization of costs. The results show that it is possible to generate synergies in 45% of the market periods and an average profit of 3.4 M(sic) per year. There are enough reasons to implement the coordination procedures between the Iberian TSOs in order to manage their own SRs in a profitable and reliable way, and to become more competitive when exchanging with other European TSOs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	6	13	0142-0615	1879-3517		WOS:000464090400044		J	Tlili, Olfa; Mansilla, Christine; Frimat, David; Perez, Yannick					Mansilla, Christine/0000-0001-6838-706X			Hydrogen market penetration feasibility assessment: Mobility and natural gas markets in the US, Europe, China and Japan								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				44	31			16048	16068		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.04.226				JUN 21 2019	2019	Making it possible to bridge between different sectors thanks to its versatility, hydrogen is a promising enabler for a multi-sectorial decarbonisation. The remaining question is how feasible it is to substitute the current carbonized technologies already prevailing in the markets by new low-carbon hydrogen systems that can be more expensive today and by which timeframe hydrogen can reach the required competitiveness.The market entry feasibility in the transport and natural gas sectors is assessed for USA, Europe, Japan, and China, and for different timeframes (up to 2040). According to the results, the most promising market in the four regions is hydrogen for mobility. This market even presents a potential room for taxation in the medium term. In contrast, blending with natural gas struggles to reach competitiveness. Both industrial and political efforts are required in the two markets in order to lower the costs and prepare a suitable market penetration environment. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We discuss the efforts in Norway to reach the country's and the Paris/Katowice meetings' ambitious goals of a carbon-neutral society. Energy sustainability and the abatement of CO2 emissions have a central place in the Norwegian debate. In this perspective, we take a look at policies, strategies, and actions in Norway to realize its ambitious goals from a technological and materials development standpoint, as we are facing the change of pace after the Paris agreement in 2015 and the Katowice 2018 global climate panel meeting. Among the largest exporters of fossil fuels, Norway compensates by intensive investments in the development of carbon capture and sequestration. Following a growing debate involving the entire society, the Norwegian government has taken on aggressive strategies toward the decarbonization of energy production. We herein discuss the activities going on and the peculiar situation in Norway, which lives the rich life provided by fossil fuels while tasting the dream of being the climate knight of the world.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	2329-2229	2329-2237		WOS:000471622500001		J	Wood, Richard; Grubb, Michael; Anger-Kraavi, Annela; Pollitt, Hector; Rizzo, Ben; Alexandri, Eva; Stadler, Konstantin; Moran, Dan; Hertwich, Edgar; Tukker, Arnold				Hertwich, Edgar/Y-9537-2019; Tukker, Arnold/M-4596-2013; Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015	Hertwich, Edgar/0000-0002-4934-3421; Tukker, Arnold/0000-0002-8229-2929; Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Grubb, Michael/0000-0003-2393-3041; Anger-Kraavi, Annela/0000-0002-6273-4945; Stadler, Konstantin/0000-0002-1548-201X			Beyond peak emission transfers: historical impacts of globalization and future impacts of climate policies on international emission transfers								CLIMATE POLICY											10.1080/14693062.2019.1619507		JUN 2019			2019	Globalization of supply chains has resulted in rapid increases in emission transfers from the developing to the developed world. As outsourcing has risen, developed countries have been able to decarbonize domestically, at the expense of increased emissions in developing countries. However, the rapid improvement of carbon efficiency in developing regions together with the post-2008 deceleration in international trade raises the question of whether such embodied emission transfers have peaked. Here we update historical analysis, finding that emission transfers between OECD and non-OECD countries peaked in 2006, and have been declining since. The reversal is principally due to the reduction in the emissions intensity of traded goods, rather than the volume of trade. A more recent decline in embodied emissions transfers is also observed in trade between developing countries. We analyse whether these trends are likely to continue, by exploring a baseline and a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) scenario with the Macro-ejconometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model (E3ME) model. The results suggest that absolute embodied emissions will plateau at current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels, and differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC policies will not result in significant carbon leakage. However, the share of national footprint embodied in imports, at least for countries with ambitious decarbonization policies, will likely increase. This suggests that, despite the world-wide stabilization of emissions transfers, addressing emissions embodied in imports will become increasingly important for reducing carbon footprints. Key policy insights Emissions embodied in imports have plateaued since 2006, and are unlikely to return to the peak of the mid-2000s. For developed countries, as domestic decarbonization occurs, the share of emissions embodied in imports as a percentage of the total national carbon footprint will increase. The Paris NDCs in themselves are unlikely to cause significant carbon leakage. Climate policy will ideally focus on reducing both production and consumption emissions, through a variety of mechanisms, especially centred around international assistance.									2	0	0	0	0	2	5	5	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000472296000001		J	Romijn, Erika; Coppus, Ruben; De Sy, Veronique; Herold, Martin; Roman-Cuesta, Rosa Maria; Verchot, Louis				Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012	Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886			Land Restoration in Latin America and the Caribbean: An Overview of Recent, Ongoing and Planned Restoration Initiatives and Their Potential for Climate Change Mitigation								FORESTS				10	6						10.3390/f10060510				JUN 2019	2019	Land degradation is a globally recognized problem and restoration of degraded land is currently high on the international agenda. Forest landscape restoration and other restorative ecosystem management activities are important measures that contribute towards reaching the objectives of the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares by 2030. In this context, many restoration projects are being planned and implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We present an overview of the location, goals and activities, and an estimated climate change mitigation potential of 154 recent, ongoing and planned restoration projects in LAC. Our analysis suggests that most projects are located in the humid tropics and less attention is paid to drylands. Increasing vegetation cover, biodiversity recovery and recovery of ecological processes are the most common goals. Restorative activities to fulfil these goals were diverse and were related to the type and source of funding that projects receive. For example, projects implemented through the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) generally rely on natural or assisted regeneration over large areas (>20,000 ha), whereas Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects establish forest plantations, often including exotic monocultures, in smaller project areas (<5000 ha). Projects that are specifically implemented within the scope of Initiative 20 x 20 and other local initiatives that target the local environmental problems, are more varied and rely on a wider portfolio of restorative activities, such as erosion control, exclusion of grazing and mixed plantations. These projects are usually implemented in smaller project areas (<5000 ha). All projects had the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by storing additional forest aboveground biomass through natural regeneration, assisted regeneration or establishing a plantation. Further analysis of the implemented activities is an important next step to investigate their effectiveness in terms of goals achieved under Initiative 20 x 20 and the Bonn Challenge. This would provide information for future restoration projects and upscaling of restorative activities in a wider area.									0	0	0	0	0	0	10	10	1999-4907			WOS:000475305000050		J	Tahir, Muhammad Faizan; Chen, Haoyong; Javed, Muhammad Sufyan; Jameel, Irfan; Khan, Asad; Adnan, Saifullah				Tahie, Muhammad Faizan/R-1369-2019; ADNAN, SAIFULLAH/N-2442-2019; Jamil, Irfan/O-2462-2014	Tahie, Muhammad Faizan/0000-0001-9138-3323; Javed, Muhammad Sufyan/0000-0002-2771-0251; Jamil, Irfan/0000-0001-9779-7973			Integration of Different Individual Heating Scenarios and Energy Storages into Hybrid Energy System Model of China for 2030								ENERGIES				12	11					2083	10.3390/en12112083				JUN 1 2019	2019	Traditional energy supply infrastructures are on the brink of facing a major transformation due to energy security concerns, environment pollution, renewable energy intermittency and fossil fuel scarcity. A hybrid energy system constitutes the integration of different energy carriers like electricity, heat and fuel which play a vital role in addressing the above challenges. Various technological options like combined heat and power, heat pumps, electrolysers and energy storages ease out multiple carrier integration in an energy hub to increase system flexibility and efficiency. This work models the hybrid energy system of China for the year 2030 by using EnergyPLAN. Atmosphere decarbonization is achieved by replacing conventional coal and natural gas boilers with alternative individual heating sources like hydrogen operated micro combined heat and power natural gas micro combined heat and power and heat pumps. Moreover, rockbed storage as well as single and double penstock pumped hydro storages are added in the proposed system in order to cope with the stochastic nature of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar photovoltaic. The technical simulation strategy is employed to analyze the optimal combination of energy producing components by determining annual costs, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The results substantiate that a heat pump and double penstock pumped hydro storage addition to the individual heating and electricity network not only proves to be an economically viable option but also reduces fuel consumption and emissions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3	1996-1073			WOS:000472635900050		J	Lehotsky, Lukas; Cernoch, Filip; Osicka, Jan; Ocelik, Petr				Cernoch, Filip/X-8648-2019; Osicka, Jan/AAB-7093-2019; Lehotsky, Lukas/S-1800-2019; Ocelik, Petr/D-3252-2016	Cernoch, Filip/0000-0002-2617-6456; Lehotsky, Lukas/0000-0002-7332-8782; /0000-0002-8040-5002; Ocelik, Petr/0000-0002-0690-265X			When climate change is missing: Media discourse on coal mining in the Czech Republic								ENERGY POLICY				129				774	786		10.1016/j.enpol.2019.02.065				JUN 2019	2019	One of the EU's main decarbonization goals is a reduction in the energy use of coal. It would be a mistake, however, to assume that public support for decarbonization can be gained automatically by pointing out threats from climate change, particularly in light of the role coal plays in the local and national economy and in energy security. In this article we search for factors affecting public support for a coal phase-out in media content. According to the theory of agenda setting, the media establishes problems calling for solutions and influences public perceptions of the (un)importance of those problems. We illustrate this case on the example of the Czech Republic. The paper demonstrates that Czech media has cultivated a discursive environment in which coal mining is separated from coal combustion, neglecting the inevitable interconnection of these two processes; coal consumption is not characterized as an environmental problem; and the economic problems of private companies more easily become public problems, making future coal phase-out policies harder to implement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000468012900070		J	Florencia Zabaloy, Maria; Yesica Recalde, Marina; Guzowski, Carina					Recalde, Marina/0000-0003-1100-8588			Are energy efficiency policies for household context dependent?

Despite their cost-effectivity, some of the most important household energy efficiency measures are often not implemented. There are different barriers that energy policy has to overcome to support their delivery. Nonetheless, specific situations may result in a bad performance of energy efficiency policies. It is crucial to understand which are the main characteristics, or enabling conditions, that affect the policy in order to consider them in the process of policy design.In this context, the aim of the paper is to contribute to the literature on energy efficiency in the household sector, by discussing the relevance of enabling conditions for the performance of the policies, and proposing a methodology framework to analyze these enabling frameworks. An approach to transform qualitative information into quantitative data also represents a contribution to the literature. The methodology consists of an adaptation of the broadly used multicriteria analysis (MCA). As an initial empirical study, a set of Latin American countries have been chosen, namely Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, to study these conditions in 2016.Findings show that Uruguay and Chile have the best boundary conditions to promote energy efficiency, followed by Brazil and Colombia which has presented difficulties in different boundary conditions. Results also highlight that the implementation of household energy efficiency policies is highly dependent on country context. In order to develop an enabling framework, it is relevant to count with a strong commitment, awareness raising, as well as price policies, financing access and favorable macroeconomic conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3	2214-6296	2214-6326		WOS:000468215900005		J	Tran, Dat Q.; Kurkalova, Lyubov A.

However, substantial amounts of soil carbon are lost when farmers interrupt continuous use of conservation tillage with conventional tillage. Conservation tillage is spreading, but little is known about the behavioral persistence in tillage decisions. To address the gap in the literature, we estimate county-specific Markov models of tillage-crop choices, and use the predicted probabilities of alternative two- and three-year tillage rotations to evaluate spatial variation and temporal persistence in conservation tillage adoption for the state of Iowa (U.S). We find that the county-average probabilities of continuous conservation tillage range between 0.133 and 0.295, and vary significantly among crop rotations. We also find a statistically strong positive effect of the incidence of the highly erodible land on the county-average use of continuous conservation tillage. Our results underscore the importance of dynamic modeling for understanding behavioral persistence in tillage decisions, and the interdependence between farmers' crop and tillage rotations.

Maintaining and increasing blue carbon is an integral component of strategies to mitigate global warming. Marine vegetated ecosystems (especially seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and tidal marshes) are blue carbon hotspots and their degradation and loss worldwide have reduced organic carbon stocks and increased CO2 emissions. Carbon markets, and conservation and restoration schemes aimed at enhancing blue carbon sequestration and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions, will be aided by knowing the provenance and fate of blue carbon. We review and critique current methods and the potential of nascent methods to track the provenance and fate of organic carbon, including: bulk isotopes, compound-specific isotopes, biomarkers, molecular properties, and environmental DNA (eDNA). We find that most studies to date have used bulk isotopes to determine provenance, but this approach often cannot distinguish the contribution of different primary producers to organic carbon in depositional marine environments. Based on our assessment, we recommend application of multiple complementary methods. In particular, the use of carbon and nitrogen isotopes of lipids along with eDNA have a great potential to identify the source and quantify the contribution of different primary producers to sedimentary organic carbon in marine ecosystems. Despite the promising potential of these new techniques, further research is needed to validate them. This critical overview can inform future research to help underpin methodologies for the implementation of blue carbon focused climate change mitigation schemes.									1	0	0	1	0	1	10	10		2296-7745		WOS:000468495600001		J	Mata, Erika; Wanemark, Joel; Nik, Vahid M.; Kalagasidis, Angela Sasic								Economic feasibility of building retrofitting mitigation potentials: Climate change uncertainties for Swedish cities								APPLIED ENERGY				242				1022	1035		10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.042				MAY 15 2019	2019	Deep and rapid decarbonization of the building sector requires energy demand reductions and the incorporation of renewable-energy sources. Energy retrofitting of existing buildings is a central strategy in climate mitigation and has often been highlighted as a cost-effective strategy. However, decisions on these strategies are often hampered by modeling assessments that are limited by contextual, methodological, parametric, input, or output constraints. Here, we present a novel methodology to investigate the solid economic feasibility in building retrofit evaluations with mitigation measures. We first calculate the variations in the energy saving potentials and costs for 13 energy saving measures and five climate change scenarios. We then compare the obtained uncertainty due to a changing climate to other uncertainties, such as the boundaries for emission inventories and energy system development.Four cities in Sweden are modeled, which are responsible for half of the country's residential energy use. We find that the profitability of the retrofitting actions is primarily determined based on the annualized investments and energy saving potentials. Future climate has a less determinant role, with uncertainties similar to those of future consumer price development and fuel emission factors. Retrofits that only affect the energy need for space heating are more robust than changes in electricity usage. We conclude that strategies for building retrofitting should focus on prioritizing energy savings and mobilizing investments that may not be profitable based on the current techno-economic perspective.									1	0	0	0	0	1	7	7	0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000470045800077		J	Conci, Mira; Konstantinou, Thaleia; van den Dobbelsteen, Andy; Schneider, Jens					Konstantinou, Thaleia/0000-0001-7085-312X; Schneider, Jens/0000-0003-2680-9628			Trade-off between the economic and environmental impact of different decarbonisation strategies for residential buildings								BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT				155				137	144		10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.03.051				MAY 15 2019	2019	German residential multi-family buildings in the 1950s-1970s age group are a relevant case study to assess the degree of certainty in meeting climate targets for the built environment. This research evaluates the contribution of traditional strategies, and whether innovative strategies perform environmentally and economically better for this purpose. We use LCA to define a benchmark for the environmental impact, expressed as lifecycle GWP, and LCC to assess the economic impact, expressed as Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The two indicators are evaluated in a Pareto optimal method. We consider combinations of strategies for the thermal envelope, the building services, and the integration of locally available renewable energy in five existing buildings. Results show that accelerating the implementation rate of traditional strategies contributes only partially to raise the degree of certainty in reaching climate targets. For this purpose, innovative building services strategies as well as the extensive integration of local energy generation from renewable sources is required, even if the GWP reduction target of electricity from the main grid is met. The use of renewable energy has a much bigger impact on the overall GWP balance than the choice between a standard renovation and a minimal renovation of the building envelope. IRR tends to sink with GWP. We conclude that a regulated benchmark for the environmental lifecycle impact of residential building projects will help to introduce the trade-off assessment necessary to identify economically sustainable strategies that increase the level of certainty in meeting climate targets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	0360-1323	1873-684X		WOS:000464943500012		J	Ahmadi, Mohammad Hossein; Madvar, Mohammad Dehghani; Sadeghzadeh, Milad; Rezaei, Mohammad Hossein; Herrera, Manuel; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin				; Herrera Fernandez, Manuel/J-2097-2015; Sadeghzadeh, Milad/P-3943-2018	Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X; Herrera Fernandez, Manuel/0000-0001-9662-0017; Sadeghzadeh, Milad/0000-0001-8574-5463; Ahmadi, Mohammad Hossein/0000-0002-0097-2534			Current Status Investigation and Predicting Carbon Dioxide Emission in Latin American Countries by Connectionist Models								ENERGIES				12	10					1916	10.3390/en12101916				MAY 2 2019	2019	Currently, one of the biggest concerns of human beings is greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide emissions in developed and under-developed countries. In this study, connectionist models including LSSVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) and evolutionary methods are employed for predicting the amount of CO emission in six Latin American countries, i.e., Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Venezuela and Uruguay. The studied region is modelled based on the available input data in terms of million tons including oil (million tons), gas (million tons oil equivalent), coal (million tons oil equivalent), (million tons oil equivalent) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, the available patents in the field of climate change mitigation in six Latin American countries, namely Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Venezuela and Uruguay, have been reviewed and analysed. The results show that except Venezuela, all other mentioned countries have invested in renewable energy R&D activities. Brazil and Argentina have the highest share of renewable energies, which account for 60% and 72%, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	6	6	1996-1073			WOS:000471016700095		J	Vielstaedte, Lisa; Linke, Peter; Schmidt, Mark; Sommer, Stefan; Haeckel, Matthias; Braack, Malte; Wallmann, Klaus				Linke, Peter/A-4401-2014; Schmidt, Mark/B-5230-2016	Linke, Peter/0000-0001-7373-7335; Schmidt, Mark/0000-0002-4298-9617			Footprint and detectability of a well leaking CO2 in the Central North Sea: Implications from a field experiment and numerical modelling								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL				84				190	203		10.1016/j.ijggc.2019.03.012				MAY 2019	2019	Existing wells pose a risk for the loss of carbon dioxide (CO2) from storage sites, which might compromise the suitability of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as climate change mitigation options. Here, we show results of a controlled CO2 release experiment at the Sleipner CO2 storage site and numerical simulations that evaluate the detectability and environmental consequences of a well leaking CO2 into the Central North Sea (CNS). Our field measurements and numerical results demonstrate that the detectability and impact of a leakage of < 55 t yr(-1) of CO2 would be limited to bottom waters and a small area around the leak, due to rapid CO2 bubble dissolution in seawater within the lower 2 m of the water column and quick dispersion of the dissolved CO2 plume by strong tidal currents. As such, the consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are found to be insignificant in terms of storage performance. Only prolonged leakage along numerous wells might compromise long-term CO2 storage and may adversely affect the local marine ecosystem. Since many abandoned wells leak natural gas into the marine environment, hydrocarbon provinces with a high density of wells may not always be the most suitable areas for CO2 storage.									1	0	0	1	0	1	5	5	1750-5836	1878-0148		WOS:000464961200018		J	Contreras, Gabriela; Platania, Federico								Economic and policy uncertainty in climate change mitigation: The London Smart City case scenario								TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE				142		SI		384	393		10.1016/j.techfore.2018.07.018				MAY 2019	2019	Despite the overwhelming consensus within the scientific community concerning the causes and effects of climate change, decision-making processes often do not point out in the same direction. In order to effectively and satisfactorily tackle climate change, a legally and politically binding long-term policy architecture is needed. In practice, however, central governments and international policymakers have been unable to provide a successful policy architecture. Yet, city-level initiatives within the Smart City framework are a promising way to tackle climate change. An example of such a Smart City framework is the London Environment Strategy (LES). In this paper, we propose a zero mean reverting model for greenhouse gas emissions to quantitatively analyze its consistency with the 2050 Zero Carbon objectives. We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport. We find that, on average, only transport improves the historical greenhouse gas emissions trend, and most of this reduction comes from Smart Mobility and/or Smart Regulation programs focusing on the environment.									1	0	0	0	0	1	12	17	0040-1625	1873-5509		WOS:000462690500031		J	Lin, Bo-Jhih; Silveira, Edgar A.; Colin, Baptiste; Chen, Wei-Hsin; Lin, Yu-Ying; Leconte, Francois; Petrissans, Anelie; Rousset, Patrick; Petrissans, Mathieu				Chen, Wei-Hsin/S-2033-2018	Chen, Wei-Hsin/0000-0001-5009-3960; A.

To aid in process and reactor design, the aim of this work is to conduct thermal degradation kinetics of wood. A two-step kinetics model is developed to predict the elemental composition (C, H, and 0) and devolatilization dynamics of wood materials during heat treatment in a pilot-scale reactor by kinetic analysis. A hardwood poplar (Populus nigra) and a softwood fir (Abies pectinata) sever as feedstock, and the experiments are carried out at 200-230 degrees C with a heating rate of 0.2 degrees C min(-1) in a low-pressure environment (200 hPa). The predictions in the weight losses of the woods are in a good agreement with the experimental data. The evolutions of solids, volatiles, elements (C, H, and O), and the heating values of treated woods are further analyzed. The predictions suggest that the intermediate solid is the main product, and almost all the woods are converted when the treatment temperature is as high as 230 degrees C. The devolatilization process, which is responsible for the mass loss of wood, can be clearly identified, and the volatile liberation amounts from poplar and fir at 230 degrees C are 17.05 and 12.44 wt%, respectively. The predicted HHVs of treated woods from the empirical formula are between 19.62 and 20.55 MJ kg and the enhancement factors at the end of treatment are between 1.01 and 1.07 which is close to torrefied wood after light torrefaction. During the treatment, the extents of decarbonization, dehydrogenation, and deoxygenation in fir are all smaller than those in poplar, resulting from the lower intensity of devolatilization in the former.									0	0	0	0	0	0	10	15	0926-6690	1872-633X		WOS:000460991700042		J	Bair, Lucas S.; Yackulic, Charles B.; Schmidt, John C.; Perry, Denielle M.; Kirchhoff, Christine J.; Chief, Karletta; Colombi, Benedict J.

This is partly because of increasing recognition of diverse and unintended social-ecological consequences of dams. Today, resource managers are recognizing the wide array of tradeoffs and are including a more diverse group of stakeholders in decision making for individual dams. Yet decisions at the regional scale maintain a focus on a limited number of resources and objectives, leading to inefficient and inequitable outcomes. Social-ecological changes compounded by climate change challenge this management paradigm. Increasing water demands for humans and the environment and renewed interest in hydropower present opportunities for operations that include climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies while considering tradeoffs and equitable responses at the regional scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000484783900004		J	Cunsolo, Ashlee; Harper, Sherilee L.

Agro-ecological service crop could be profitably cultivated to improve soil characteristics and reduce CO2 emissions under Mediterranean environment. Two-year field trials were conducted in central Italy. The treatments were three agro-ecological service crops (hairy vetch, oat, and oilseed rape) and a no-service cover. Plant development, soil characteristics, and CO2 emissions were measured. Oat and oilseed rape showed a rapid growth, while hairy vetch started to grow rapidly only after the cold period. Soil CO2 emissions trend was similar among the agro-ecological service crops and tended to decrease during the cold period, then gradually increased until April when warm temperatures were observed. The high soil CO2 emissions and respiration index observed in hairy vetch probably stimulated mineral nutrients, especially nitrogen, to become more available in the soil compared to oat and oilseed rape throughout the decomposition of soil organic matter. These results confirmed that the cultivation of agro-ecological service crops, especially hairy vetch, could represent a suitable strategy for enhancing carbon sequestration and lead to a mitigation of CO2 emissions during the fallow period and could thus contribute to the climate change mitigation.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	0		2077-0472		WOS:000467306400004		J	De Giusti, Giovanna; Kristjanson, Patricia; Rufino, Mariana C.

This work examines the agroecological and socio-economic factors that condition profitability and acceptance of agroforestry by smallholder farmers in Western Kenya. We differentiate the use of trees according to the permanence of carbon sequestration, introducing a distinction between practices with high mitigation benefits (timber) and practices with low mitigation benefits (fuelwood). This study goes beyond the analysis of incentives to plant trees to identify incentives to plant trees that lead to high mitigation outcomes. We show that environmental factors shaping the production system largely drive the choice for planting trees with high mitigation benefits. Most trees in the area are used for fuelwood, and the charcoal economy outweighs economic factors influencing planting of trees with high mitigation benefits. Larger households tend to produce more fuelwood, while high mitigation uses are positively related to the education level of the household head, and to the belief that trees play a positive role for the environment. Where trees contribute significantly to incomes, the norm is that they are owned by men. We conclude that although agroforestry is not perceived to be more profitable than traditional agricultural practices, it plays an important economic and environmental role by supporting subsistence through provision of fuelwood and could relieve pressure upon common forest resources. In areas with high tree cover, it also represents a way of storing capital to deal with risks and cope with uncertainty.									0	0	0	0	0	0	7	7	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000465577100005		J	Hertwich, Edgar G.; Ali, Saleem; Ciacci, Luca; Fishman, Tomer; Heeren, Niko; Masanet, Eric; Asghari, Farnaz Nojavan; Olivetti, Elsa; Pauliuk, Stefan; Tu, Qingshi; Wolfram, Paul				Heeren, Niko/N-3390-2017; Fishman, Tomer/C-9772-2015; Hertwich, Edgar/Y-9537-2019; Masanet, Eric/I-5649-2012; Ciacci, Luca/T-9280-2019; Ali, Saleem/I-1545-2013	Heeren, Niko/0000-0003-4967-6557; Fishman, Tomer/0000-0003-4405-2382; Hertwich, Edgar/0000-0002-4934-3421; Ciacci, Luca/0000-0002-5151-5384; Ali, Saleem/0000-0002-2943-9557			Material efficiency strategies to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, vehicles, and electronics-a review								ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS				14	4					043004	10.1088/1748-9326/ab0fe3				APR 2019	2019	As one quarter of global energy use serves the production of materials, the more efficient use of these materials presents a significant opportunity for the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the renewed interest of policy makers in the circular economy, material efficiency (ME) strategies such as light-weighting and downsizing of and lifetime extension for products, reuse and recycling of materials, and appropriate material choice are being promoted. Yet, the emissions savings from ME remain poorly understood, owing in part to the multitude of material uses and diversity of circumstances and in part to a lack of analytical effort. We have reviewed emissions reductions from ME strategies applied to buildings, cars, and electronics. We find that there can be a systematic trade-off between material use in the production of buildings, vehicles, and appliances and energy use in their operation, requiring a careful life cycle assessment of ME strategies. We find that the largest potential emission reductions quantified in the literature result from more intensive use of and lifetime extension for buildings and the light-weighting and reduced size of vehicles. Replacing metals and concrete with timber in construction can result in significant GHG benefits, but trade-offs and limitations to the potential supply of timber need to be recognized. Repair and remanufacturing of products can also result in emission reductions, which have been quantified only on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to generalize. The recovery of steel, aluminum, and copper from building demolition waste and the end-of-life vehicles and appliances already results in the recycling of base metals, which achieves significant emission reductions. Higher collection rates, sorting efficiencies, and the alloy-specific sorting of metals to preserve the function of alloying elements while avoiding the contamination of base metals are important steps to further reduce emissions.									1	0	0	0	0	1	13	13	1748-9326			WOS:000465011300001		J	Kay, Sonja; Rega, Carlo; Moreno, Gerardo; den Herder, Michael; Palma, Joao H.

Using a transdisciplinary approach, we combined scientific and technical knowledge to evaluate nine environmental pressures in terms of ecosystem services in European farmland and assessed the carbon storage potential of suitable agroforestry systems, proposed by regional experts. First, regions with potential environmental pressures were identified with respect to soil health (soil erosion by water and wind, low soil organic carbon), water quality (water pollution by nitrates, salinization by irrigation), areas affected by climate change (rising temperature), and by underprovision in biodiversity (pollination and pest control pressures, loss of soil biodiversity). The maps were overlaid to identify areas where several pressures accumulate. In total, 94.4% of farmlands suffer from at least one environmental pressure, pastures being less affected than arable lands. Regional hotspots were located in north-western France, Denmark, Central Spain, north and south-western Italy, Greece, and eastern Romania. The 10% of the area with the highest number of accumulated pressures were defined as Priority Areas, where the implementation of agroforestry could be particularly effective. In a second step, European agroforestry experts were asked to propose agroforestry practices suitable for the Priority Areas they were familiar with, and identified 64 different systems covering a wide range of practices. These ranged from hedgerows on field boundaries to fast growing coppices or scattered single tree systems. Third, for each proposed system, the carbon storage potential was assessed based on data from the literature and the results were scaled-up to the Priority Areas. As expected, given the wide range of agroforestry practices identified, the carbon sequestration potentials ranged between 0.09 and 7.29 t C ha(-1) a(-1). Implementing agroforestry on the Priority Areas could lead to a sequestration of 2.1 to 63.9 million t C a(-1)(7.78 and 234.85 million t CO2eq a(-1)) depending on the type of agroforestry. This corresponds to between 1.4 and 43.4% of European agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, promoting agroforestry in the Priority Areas would contribute to mitigate the environmental pressures identified there. We conclude that the strategic and spatially targeted establishment of agroforestry systems could provide an effective means of meeting EU policy objectives on GHG emissions whilst providing a range of other important benefits.									1	0	0	0	0	1	16	22	0264-8377	1873-5754		WOS:000463127200051		J	Waisman, Henri; Bataille, Chris; Winkler, Harald; Jotzo, Frank; Shukla, Priyadarshi; Colombier, Michel; Buira, Daniel; Criqui, Patrick; Fischedick, Manfred; Kainuma, Mikiko; La Rovere, Emilio; Pye, Steve; Safonov, George; Siagian, Ucok; Teng, Fei; Virdis, Maria-Rosa; Williams, Jim; Young, Soogil; Anandarajah, Gabrial; Boer, Rizaldi; Cho, Yongsun; Denis-Ryan, Amandine; Dhar, Subash; Gaeta, Maria; Gesteira, Claudio; Haley, Ben; Hourcade, Jean-Charles; Liu, Qiang; Lugovoy, Oleg; Masui, Toshihiko; Mathy, Sandrine; Oshiro, Ken; Parrado, Ramiro; Pathak, Minal; Potashnikov, Vladimir; Samadi, Sascha; Sawyer, David; Spencer, Thomas; Tovilla, Jordi; Trollip, Hilton				Oshiro, Ken/W-9746-2018; LA ROVERE, EMILIO/Y-9646-2019; Safonov, George/Q-6420-2019; Safonov, George V/C-8545-2014; Potashnikov, Vladimir/N-1892-2018	Oshiro, Ken/0000-0001-6720-409X; LA ROVERE, EMILIO/0000-0002-9186-7069; Safonov, George/0000-0001-6568-8318; Safonov, George V/0000-0001-6568-8318; Jotzo, Frank/0000-0002-2856-847X; Waisman, Henri/0000-0001-7450-4912; Potashnikov, Vladimir/0000-0001-9237-3100; Winkler, Harald/0000-0002-5826-4071			A pathway design framework for national low greenhouse gas emission development strategies								NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE				9	4			261	268		10.1038/s41558-019-0442-8				APR 2019	2019	The Paris Agreement introduces long-term strategies as an instrument to inform progressively more ambitious emission reduction objectives, while holding development goals paramount in the context of national circumstances.

Hence identification of a primary tillage implement can be a powerful strategy to mitigate the climate change through reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) for cleaner agricultural production and to improve the environment quality. Therefore, the present study focuses on identifying the energy efficient and environment friendly primary tillage implement by analyzing the energy and carbon efficiency indicators. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of commonly used primary and secondary tillage implements in single or in combination for seed bed preparation in developing countries like Cultivator (CV), Cultivator followed by Disc Harrow (CVH), Disc Plough (DP), Disc Plough followed by Disc Harrow (DH), Mould Board Plough (MP), Mould Board Plough followed by Disc Harrow (MPH), Rotovator (R0), Bullock Drawn Plough (BP), Bullock Drawn Harrow (BH), No Tillage (NT) on energy conservation, environment impact and global warming potential. The aim of the study was to identify climate smart primary tillage implement for clean production technology to improve the environmental quality in semi-arid rainfed conditions of India. CV, MP and RO recorded higher soil based greenhouse gas emissions. NT and Animal Drawn Implements recorded lower soil based greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel consumption-based CO2 emissions for preparatory cultivation and sowing were found to be 92, 81, 60, 60 and 40 per cent lower in BP, BH, tractor drawn CV, DH, RO respectively as compared to MPH RO and MPH f recorded higher total CO2 equivalents over other tillage implements used in the present experiment. Among the different methods, reduced tillage with DH recorded higher energy use efficiency and carbon efficiency. Our study indicated that primary tillage implement with minimum soil disturbance and lower number of operations is an ideal environment friendly practice for mitigation of climate change as it recorded low Global Warming Potential (GWP), energy and cost of cultivation with minimum yield reduction.

A qualitative comparative analysis of the interplay between institutional and policy arena factors								CLIMATE POLICY				19	3			315	328		10.1080/14693062.2018.1507897				MAR 16 2019	2019	Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has emerged as a promising climate change mitigation mechanism in developing countries. In order to identify the enabling conditions for achieving progress in the implementation of an effective, efficient and equitable REDD+, this paper examines national policy settings in a comparative analysis across 13 countries with a focus on both institutional context and the actual setting of the policy arena. The evaluation of REDD+ revealed that countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America are showing some progress, but some face backlashes in realizing the necessary transformational change to tackle deforestation and forest degradation. A Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) undertaken as part of the research project showed two enabling institutional configurations facilitating progress: (1) the presence of already initiated policy change; and (2) scarcity of forest resources combined with an absence of any effective forestry framework and policies. When these were analysed alongside policy arena conditions, the paper finds that the presence of powerful transformational coalitions combined with strong ownership and leadership, and performance-based funding, can both work as a strong incentive for achieving REDD+ goals. Key policy insights The positive push of already existing policy change, or the negative stress of resource scarcity together with lack of effective policies, represents institutional conditions that can support REDD+ progress. Progress also requires the presence of powerful transformational coalitions and strong ownership and leadership. In the absence of these internal drivers, performance-based funding can work as a strong incentive. When comparing three assessments (2012, 2014, 2016) of REDD+ enabling conditions, some progress in establishing processes of change can be observed over time; however, the overall fluctuation in progress of most countries reveals the difficulty in changing the deforestation trajectory away from business as usual.									4	0	0	0	0	4	7	19	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000455949300004		J	Bentsen, Niclas Scott; Jorgensen, Johannes Ravn; Stupak, Inge; Jorgensen, Uffe; Taghizadeh-Toosi, Arezoo				Bentsen, Niclas Scott/E-4766-2010; Jorgensen, Johannes R/E-9797-2016; Jorgensen, Johannes Ravn/M-1273-2019	Bentsen, Niclas Scott/0000-0002-5130-0818; Jorgensen, Johannes R/0000-0003-3133-2350; Jorgensen, Johannes Ravn/0000-0003-3133-2350; Stupak, Inge/0000-0002-9984-5024			Dynamic sustainability assessment of heat and electricity production based on agricultural crop residues in Denmark								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				213				491	507		10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.12.194				MAR 10 2019	2019	Bioenergy use is expected to increase significantly to support energy strategies and to meet climate targets in a large number of countries. Agricultural residues as an energy resource have attracted a lot of interest, as the use of residue biomass is perceived as beneficial to mitigate greenhouse gas emission and to be less harmful to the environment than other biomass resources. Here we present a holistic sustainability assessment of the use of cereal straw for heat and electricity production in Denmark. The assessment applies a methodology and framework developed by the Global Bioenergy Partnership. Sixteen sustainability indicators within the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are quantified or assessed qualitatively together with their development over time from year 2000-2014/2015. The assessment points to a number of benefits of straw based bioenergy as reductions in GHG emissions, income generation and jobs for a rural population, reduced use of fossil fuels and increased diversity of the national energy supply. These benefits come at a risk of soil degradation and soil organic matter mining, of increased emissions of non-greenhouse gases. The assessment shows that land allocation to straw harvest for energy has increased over time together with land productivity. The diversity of the national energy supply has increased over time just as the infrastructure required to support straw to energy supply chains. Ecologically there is a potential for further use of agricultural residue biomass for energy. To realise the potential sustainably, attention should be put on developing guidelines or regulation on biomass harvest, on avoidance of environmental burden shifting, on logistics and efficient conversion to energy services, and on maintaining a suitable organisational and policy framework. The framework of the Global Bioenergy Partnership proved to be a versatile tool for the assessment of bioenergy sustainability, also in a developed country. It is, however, relying on specific data sources and formats, which in many cases are not readily available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we explore incorporation of new dark food chains into human food systems, drawing inspiration from natural ecosystems, the history of single cell protein, and opportunities for new food production through wastewater treatment, microbial protein production, and aquaculture. The envisioned dark food chains rely upon chemoautotrophy in lieu of photosynthesis, with primary production based upon assimilation of CH4 and CO2 by methane- and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. The stoichiometry, kinetics, and thermodynamics of these bacteria are evaluated, and opportunities for recycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water are explored. Because these processes do not require light delivery, high volumetric productivities are possible; because they are exothermic, heat is available for downstream protein processing; because the feedstock gases are cheap, existing pipeline infrastructure could facilitate low-cost energy-efficient delivery in urban environments. Potential life-cycle benefits include: a protein alternative to fishmeal; partial decoupling of animal feed from human food; climate change mitigation due to decreased land use for agriculture; efficient local cycling of carbon and nutrients that offsets the need for energy-intensive fertilizers; and production of high value products, such as the prebiotic polyhydroxybutyrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	22	38	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000460709100002	30640466	J	Hewson, Jennifer; Razafimanahaka, Julie Hanta; Wright, Timothy Max; Mandimbiniaina, Rina; Mulligan, Mark; Jones, Julia P.

Land change modelling can support policy decisions by demonstrating potential impacts of policies on future deforestation and GHG emissions. We modelled land change to explore the potential impacts of expert-informed scenarios on deforestation and GHG emissions, specifically CO2 emissions, in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor in eastern Madagascar. We considered four scenarios: business as usual; effective conservation of protected areas; investment in infrastructure; and agricultural intensification. Our results highlight that effective forest conservation could deliver substantial emissions reductions, while infrastructure development will likely cause forest loss in new areas. Agricultural intensification could prevent additional forest loss if it reduced the need to clear more land while improving food security. Our study demonstrates how available land change modelling tools and scenario analyses can inform land-use policies, helping countries reconcile economic development with forest conservation and climate change mitigation commitments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	4	8	0376-8929	1469-4387		WOS:000458543700004		J	Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares; Keesstra, Saskia; Kalantari, Zahra				Halbac-Cotoara-Zamfir, Rares/E-3429-2012; keesstra, saskia/Z-5477-2019				The impact of political, socio-economic and cultural factors on implementing environment friendly techniques for sustainable land management and climate change mitigation in Romania								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				654				418	429		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.160				MAR 1 2019	2019	Throughout the history of Romania, political decisions, socio-economic measures, and cultural (traditional) characters have affected the implementation of environment friendly techniques (EFTs) policies. In the context of this paper, EFTs can be defined as solutions for the use of land resources aiming the increasing of goods for meeting the changing human needs and with neutral or positive environmental impact. Changes in the political regime have always had a visible impact on the EFTs issue in Romania. EFTs has gone through several major phases. The political impact on EFTs implementation mainly affected sustainable land management (SLM) and to a small extent, at the end of the communist era and partly during the capitalist period, dimate change mitigation. Throughout history, the political factor has dominated and influenced the capacity of the EFTs implementation process in responding to socio-economic stimuli. In addition, quality of life, rural-urban and urban-rural migrations, poverty, education level, and climate change adaptation have had impacts on the status of EFTs according to governance and political reflections. The agrarian reforms from the last two centuries, based on socioeconomic demands, have strongly influenced the capacity to implement EFTs both positively and negatively. However, the cultural factor was least affected by political and socio-economic changes as a stability factor in ensuring continued implementation of the EFTs. Currently, there is a strong need to reconsider EFTs as sustainability tools for Romanian agriculture that can cope with climate change and sustainable land management (SLM) demands. This paper presents a brief history of EFTs in Romania and their benefits in achieving SLM equilibrium, describing the impacts of political decisions, socio-economic measures, and cultural features on implementing ETEs policies.

The environmental benefits of UCG are mainly due to eliminating (i) conventional mining operations, (ii) the presence of coal miners in the underground, (iii) coal washing and fines disposal, and (iv) coal stockpiling and coal transportation activities. Furthermore, UCG has a capacity of great potential to provide a clean coal energy source by the implementing carbon capture and storage techniques as part of the energy extraction process. In this method, coal seams in the underground were converted into syngas including hydrogen (H-2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) gasses with an advanced thermochemical process. UCG operation effected significant geomechanical changes to the overburden strata. In this process, the vertical well (especially the production well) was mainly affected by the mechanical stresses and the thermal stress, induced by the high syngas temperature. This high temperature changed the mechanical, thermal, and physical properties of the coal seam and its surrounding rocks (the host rocks), finally causing instability of the vertical well, while leading to serious production and environmental problems. One of these environmental issues is the possibility of syngas leakage in to the environment, resulting in water pollution and acidification. In addition, the released syngas could trigger global warming and air pollution. This research evaluated environmental aspects of UCG vertical well (production well) based on the stability analysis. Therefore, a flow sheet form was developed for three-dimensional thermomechanical numerical modeling of an UCG vertical well by explicit Lagrangian finite difference method. In this model, a criterion was established based on normalized yielded zone area to assess the stability conditions. The methodology was able to capture all factors that influence the instability of UCG well while selecting suitable mud pressure and lining system during the well drilling process. Hence, when wellbore integrity issues arose during drilling, the mitigation strategies were applied to rectify these problems. The results demonstrated that the vertical well should be drilled at a constant mud pressure of 9MPa (megapascal), thus causing minimum environmental problems. The thermomechanical modeling provided an opportunity to assess the potential environmental impacts and identify reliable global climate change mitigation strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	9	23	1381-2386	1573-1596		WOS:000456264900003		J	Almeshqab, Fatema; Ustun, Taha Selim								Lessons learned from rural electrification initiatives in developing countries: Insights for technical, social, financial and public policy aspects								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				102				35	53		10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.035				MAR 2019	2019	1.1 billion of the world's population still does not have access to electricity in the 21st century. Most of that population resides in the rural communities in developing countries in South Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to electricity can eliminate existing problems related to health, education, social life, economy and the environment, and can increase the income of underserved communities. Most of the yet to be energized regions are in remote, isolated areas, that cannot be serviced through the central grid. While decentralized diesel generators can potentially be installed in these areas, they have a poor effect on climate change mitigation. Clean renewable energy alternatives for off-grid systems are being deployed to reduce the non-electrification rate in the world, and The United Nation Foundation's 2030 Agenda has the objective of universal access to electricity by 2030. While there has been some progress towards that goal, the challenges are countless. If no changes in models, policies and practices are made, the universal access objective will not be achieved, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa that has a level of electrification projection of 30% by 2030. To determine the necessary changes, this paper reviews the rural electrification initiatives in eight developing countries, from Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Latin America, and aims to provide an assessment of their success and to discuss the lessons that can be learned and applied on future initiatives.									2	0	0	0	0	2	6	29	1364-0321			WOS:000455404000004		J	Andric, Ivan; Koc, Muammer; Al-Ghamdi, Sami G.				; Koc, Muammer/A-3228-2015	Andric, Ivan/0000-0002-4280-5005; Al-Ghamdi, Sami/0000-0002-7416-5153; Koc, Muammer/0000-0001-6543-8116			A review of climate change implications for built environment: Impacts, mitigation measures and associated challenges in developed and developing countries								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				211				83	102		10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.11.128				FEB 20 2019	2019	This interdisciplinary review organizes, summarizes and critically analyzes the literature regarding the nexus between climate change and the built environment, its associated impacts, and the proposed mitigation measures and challenges for their implementation. While global warming-driven changes of ecosystems could have multiple impacts on the built environment (most prominently on building energy demand and related urban energy systems), the building sector presents significant potential for climate change mitigation. Study findings indicate that building renovations have significant potential for the mitigation of urban-related emissions and achieving the sustainability goals set. However, these measures should be adapted to different climate conditions and different segments of the building stock. In developed countries, where the majority of the building stock is older than 50 years, more effort should be invested into creating adequate policies for the renovation of existing building stock. In developing countries with rapid growth in the urban environment, due to a previous lack of energy-efficiency policies, the focus should be on policy development and an increase in environmental awareness among building owners/tenants. Moreover, additional research efforts should be invested into performing technoeconomic and environmental analyses of green wall performance under future climate conditions, especially within the hot and humid climates.

The policy and regulatory context for the building industry is examined in relation to the policy context for solutions and recommendations that will work for all parties. Based on this analysis, two substantive recommendations are made for improved policy design. Firstly, a decoupling of policy objectives and policy mechanisms is needed so that the policy-taking stakeholders (in design, development and construction) can reduce energy use in buildings more effectively. Secondly, policy-taking stakeholders need an explicit and diverse system in order to advocate for policy objectives. The major aspect of this work is the development of a new conceptual framework that ties together these recommendations into a continuous process of policy-making and policy-taking. This framework demonstrates an idealized system that operates simultaneously top down and bottom up, and the development of policy objectives is influenced by stakeholders of all kinds to further the goals of an energy-efficient, low-carbon built environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	150	0961-3218	1466-4321		WOS:000447469500007		J	Huang, Li; Liao, Felix Haifeng; Lohse, Kathleen A.; Larson, Danelle M.; Fragkias, Michail; Lybecker, Donna L.; Baxter, Colden V.

However, little is known about how land conservation could help mitigate adverse water-sustainability impacts. In this paper, we utilized the InVEST tool and the Residual Trends method to assess the joint effects and relative contributions of climate change and land conservation on freshwater eco-systemservices in the Portneuf River catchment in Idaho, USA. Wedeveloped five hypothesized scenarios regarding gain and loss in the enrollment of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the largest agricultural landretirement program in the U. S., plus riparian buffer and assessed their interactions with climate change. Results suggest that the realized water yield in the Portneuf River catchment would possibly be 56% less due to climate change and 24% less due to the decline of CRP enrollment. On the contrary, if CRP enrollment is promoted by similar to 30% and riparian buffer protection is implemented, the water supply reduction in the year 2050 could be changed from 56% to 26%, the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) export would be reduced by 10% and 11%, and the total suspended sediment (TSS) reduced by 17%. This study suggests that increasing implementation of the CRP would likely preserve key freshwater ecosystem services and assist proactive mitigation, especially for semiarid regions vulnerable to changing climate conditions.

This study aimed at evaluating the potential of cork granulates, a by-product of winery industry, as an organic carbon (OC) source for the treatment of hydroponic wastewaters. First, chemical characterization was performed and discussed. Secondly, batch studies were performed using synthetic hydroponic wastewater to understand the role of particle size (PS), pH and contact time (CT) on the release of OC. The suberin is the major compound, representing >50%. It was noticed that a variance on the content of suberin across species, within the same species and depending on the extraction part (belly, cork and back) could be expected. >60% of the sample is composed by carbon while <1% was nitrogen (high C:N ratio), indicating a low risk of releasing organic nitrogen. The statistical results suggested that the main effect of PS on the release of OC is greater than both, CT and pH. The chemical release of OC gets slower with time, being this effect greater as the PS increase. Moreover, estimations showed that using the 8 mm PS, the amount of water treated would be twice the amount if the S mm PS had been used. The PS seems to play an important role at design nature-based solutions (NBS) focused on denitrification. The surface response methodology indicates a significant negative interaction between CT and PS suggesting that the mathematical model could be used for further optimization studies. The reuse of organic by-products as filter media seems to be an economic and environmentally friendly alternative to enhance denitrification in NBS, while preserving natural capital. However, further real scale and long-term experiments are needed to validate cork's potential as an "internal" OC source for NBS.

On the one hand, by increasing the value placed on quality of life, creating more opportunity for environmental actors to influence policymaking and holding elected politicians accountable, an increase in democratic institution and process should promote emissions reduction. On the other hand, the desire to safeguard individual freedom presumably brings with it an aversion to intervene in lifestyle and market decisions, thereby raising the risk of climate inaction. This outcome is further encouraged by the political need to balance (conflicting) environmental and energy interests. This article evaluates the thesis that democratization promotes mitigation in light of national emissions levels from 1990 to 2012. Using data from the Freedom House, Polity IV and V-Dem indices, World Bank World Development Indicators and the World Resources Institute Climate Data Explorer it conducts a large-N investigation of the emissions levels of 147 countries. Although several quantitative studies have found that domestic political regimes affect emissions levels, this article goes beyond existing research by building a more sophisticated - multilevel- research design to determine whether democracy: (a) continues to be an important driver of emissions when country-level clustering is accounted for and (b) has uniform effects across countries. The results indicate that, even after controlling for country-level clustering and holding constant the other confounding factors, democracy is indeed a significant driver. More strikingly, they reveal that while democracies tend to have lower emissions than non-democracies, democratization spells within the same country do not have the same kind of inhibitory effects as they do between countries. This article also finds tentative evidence that the type of electoral system plays a critical role in shaping the effect of democratization on individual countries. Key policy insights Democracies tend to perform better in terms of emission levels than non-democracies. Democratization has non-uniform effects across different countries, with the type of electoral system playing a key role in determining the effect that democratization has on national emissions. Further research is needed to develop our understanding of how the political context influences emissions, especially with regard to the influence of pro and anti-decarbonisation actors.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	10	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000453574100009		J	Sun, Zhongxiao; Tukker, Arnold; Behrens, Paul				Tukker, Arnold/M-4596-2013	Tukker, Arnold/0000-0002-8229-2929; Behrens, Paul/0000-0002-2935-4799; Sun, Zhongxiao/0000-0001-8711-8260			Going Global to Local: Connecting Top-Down Accounting and Local Impacts, A Methodological Review of Spatially Explicit Input-Output Approaches								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				53	3			1048	1062		10.1021/acs.est.8b03148				FEB 5 2019	2019	Environmentally Extended Input-Output Data-bases (EEIOs) provide an effective tool for assessing environmental impacts around the world. These databases have yielded many scientific and policy relevant insights, especially through the national accounting of impacts embodied in trade. However, most approaches average out the spatial variation in different factors, usually at the level of the nation, but sometimes at the subnational level. It is a natural next step to connect trade with local environmental impacts and local consumption. Due to investments in earth observation many new data sets are now available, offering a huge potential for coupling environmental data sets with economic models such as Multi-Region Input-Output (MRIO) models. A key tool for linking these scales are Spatially Explicit Input-Output (SIO) models, which provide both demand and supply perspectives by linking producers and consumers. Here we define an SIO model as a model having a resolution greater than the underlying input output transaction matrix. Given the increasing interest in this approach, we present a timely review of the methods used, insights gained, and limitations of various approaches for integrating spatial data in input-output modeling. We highlight the evolution of these approaches, and review the methodological approaches used in SIO models so far. We investigate the temporal and spatial resolution of such approaches and analyze the general advantages and limitations of the modeling framework. Finally, we make suggestions for the future development of SIO models.									3	0	0	1	0	3	8	31	0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000458220600002	30525491	J	Houghton, Adele; Castillo-Salgado, Carlos					Houghton, Adele/0000-0002-6861-1591			Associations between Green Building Design Strategies and Community Health Resilience to Extreme Heat Events: A Systematic Review of the Evidence								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				16	4					663	10.3390/ijerph16040663				FEB 2 2019	2019	This project examined evidence linking green building design strategies with the potential to enhance community resilience to extreme heat events. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method for a systematic review, it assessed the strength of the evidence supporting the potential for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) credit requirements to reduce the adverse effects of extreme heat events and/or enhance a building's passive survivability (i.e., the ability to continue to function during utility outages) during those events. The PRISMA Flow Diagram resulted in the selection of 12 LEED for New Construction (LEED NC) credits for inclusion in the review. Following a preliminary scan of evidence supporting public health co-benefits of the LEED for Neighborhood Development rating system, queries were submitted in PubMed using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings Terms. Queries identified links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to extreme heat, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits included reducing the risk of vulnerability to heat stress and reducing heat-related morbidity and mortality. The results lay the groundwork for collaboration across the public health, civil society, climate change, and green building sectors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	3		1660-4601		WOS:000460804900142	30813482	J	Githiru, Mwangi; Njambuya, Josephine W.								Globalization and Biodiversity Conservation Problems: Polycentric REDD+ Solutions								LAND				8	2					35	10.3390/land8020035				FEB 2019	2019	Protected areas are considered the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, but face multiple problems in delivering this core objective. The growing trend of framing biodiversity and protected area values in terms of ecosystem services and human well-being may not always lead to biodiversity conservation. Although globalization is often spoken about in terms of its adverse effects to the environment and biodiversity, it also heralds unprecedented and previously inaccessible opportunities linked to ecosystem services. Biodiversity and related ecosystem services are amongst the common goods hardest hit by globalization. Yet, interconnectedness between people, institutions, and governments offers a great chance for globalization to play a role in ameliorating some of the negative impacts. Employing a polycentric governance approach to overcome the free-rider problem of unsustainable use of common goods, we argue here that REDD+, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate change mitigation scheme, could be harnessed to boost biodiversity conservation in the face of increasing globalization, both within classic and novel protected areas. We believe this offers a timely example of how an increasingly globalized world connects hitherto isolated peoples, with the ability to channel feelings and forces for biodiversity conservation. Through the global voluntary carbon market, REDD+ can enable and empower, on the one hand, rural communities in developing countries contribute to mitigation of a global problem, and on the other, individuals or societies in the West to help save species they may never see, yet feel emotionally connected to.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	3		2073-445X		WOS:000460795000014		J	Delikonstantis, Evangelos; Scapinello, Marco; Stefanidis, Georgios D.

Non-thermal plasma reactor systems that successfully perform in lab scale are investigated for this purpose. However, the feasibility of such electrified processes at industrial scale is still questionable. In this context, two process alternatives for ethylene production via plasma-assisted non-oxidative methane coupling have conceptually been designed based on previous work of our group namely, a direct plasma-assisted methane-to-ethylene process (one-step process) and a hybrid plasma-catalytic methane-to-ethylene process (two-step process). Both processes are simulated in the Aspen Plus V10 process simulator and also consider the technical limitations of a real industrial environment. The economically favorable operating window (range of operating conditions at which the target product purity is met at minimum utility cost) is defined via sensitivity analysis. Preliminary results reveal that the hybrid plasma-catalytic process requires 21% less electricity than the direct one, while the electric power consumed for the plasma-assisted reaction is the major cost driver in both processes, accounting for similar to 75% of the total electric power demand. Finally, plasma-assisted processes are not economically viable at present. However, future decrease in electricity prices due to renewable electricity production increase can radically affect process economics. Given that a break-even electricity price of 35 USD/MWh (without considering the capital cost) is calculated for the two-step plasma process and that current electricity prices for some energy intensive industries in certain countries can be as low as 50 USD/MWh, the plasma-assisted processes may become economically viable in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	2	4	5	2227-9717			WOS:000460800900014		J	Martinez-Juarez, Pablo; Chiabai, Aline; Suarez, Cristina; Quiroga, Sonia				Suarez, Cristina/O-1688-2017	Suarez, Cristina/0000-0003-2579-0734; Quiroga, Sonia/0000-0002-4269-5053			Insights on Urban and Periurban Adaptation Strategies Based on Stakeholders' Perceptions on Hard and Soft Responses to Climate Change								SUSTAINABILITY				11	3					647	10.3390/su11030647				FEB 1 2019	2019	Adapting to expected impacts of climate change is a task shared by multiple institutions and individuals, but much of this work falls over local and regional authorities, which has made them experts over the issue. At the same time, adaptation to climate change has been a research interest in different academic fields; while private companies provide research and development efforts on the issue. Views from perspectives may contain common ground and discrepancies, but benefits from the discussion may differ among these three sectors. This study shows the application of collaborative approaches to analyze impacts and adaptation measures at a local level. A stakeholder workshop was held in the city of Bilbao to discuss impacts of climate change and adaptation in the local context of the Basque Country. The contributions were proposed on three axes: impacts from climate change, good practices proposed or already in action, and costs and benefits derived from those strategies. Participants were asked to rank a series of measures and practices extracted from their previous inputs. These measures were analyzed after applying bootstrapping techniques, according to the perceived costs and benefits assigned to each of the grouped measures and practices. Participants estimated that groups containing green adaptation measures and those that had potentially positive impacts over climate change mitigation were the most efficient measures, as reduced costs combined with high benefits could lead to win-win adaptation strategies, while grey infrastructures were seen as providing high benefits at high costs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	6	2071-1050			WOS:000458929500092		J	Bryndum-Buchholz, Andrea; Tittensor, Derek P.; Blanchard, Julia L.; Cheung, William W.

These changes will significantly alter marine ecosystem structure and function with associated socio-economic impacts on ecosystem services, marine fisheries, and fishery-dependent societies. Yet how these changes may play out among ocean basins over the 21st century remains unclear, with most projections coming from single ecosystem models that do not adequately capture the range of model uncertainty. We address this by using six marine ecosystem models within the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP) to analyze responses of marine animal biomass in all major ocean basins to contrasting climate change scenarios. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), total marine animal biomass declined by an ensemble mean of 15%-30% (+/- 12%-17%) in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific, and the Indian Ocean by 2100, whereas polar ocean basins experienced a 20%-80% (+/- 35%-200%) increase. Uncertainty and model disagreement were greatest in the Arctic and smallest in the South Pacific Ocean. Projected changes were reduced under a low (RCP2.6) emissions scenario. Under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, biomass projections were highly correlated with changes in net primary production and negatively correlated with projected sea surface temperature increases across all ocean basins except the polar oceans. Ecosystem structure was projected to shift as animal biomass concentrated in different size-classes across ocean basins and emissions scenarios. We highlight that climate change mitigation measures could moderate the impacts on marine animal biomass by reducing biomass declines in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. The range of individual model projections emphasizes the importance of using an ensemble approach in assessing uncertainty of future change.									5	0	0	3	0	5	27	73	1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000456028900008	30408274	J	Helmers, Eckard; Leitao, Joana; Tietge, Uwe; Butler, Tim					Butler, Timothy/0000-0002-2219-4657; Leitao, Joana/0000-0001-7117-4452			CO2-equivalent emissions from European passenger vehicles in the years 1995-2015 based on real-world use: Assessing the climate benefit of the European "diesel boom"								ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT				198				122	132		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.10.039				FEB 1 2019	2019	A comprehensive overview is provided evaluating direct real-world CO2 emissions of both diesel and petrol cars newly registered in Europe between 1995 and 2015. Before 2011, European diesel cars emitted less CO2 per kilometre than petrol cars, but since then there is no appreciable difference in per-km CO2 emissions between diesel and petrol cars. Real-world CO2 emissions of diesel cars have not declined appreciably since 2001, while the CO2 emissions of petrol cars have been stagnant since 2012. When adding black carbon related CO2 equivalents, such as from diesel cars without particulate filters, diesel cars were discovered to have had much higher climate relevant emissions until the year 2001 when compared to petrol cars. From 2001 to 2015 CO2 equivalent emissions from new diesel cars and petrol cars were hardly distinguishable. Lifetime use phase CO2 equivalent emissions of all European passenger vehicles were modelled for 1995-2015 based on three scenarios: the historic case, another scenario freezing percentages of diesel cars at the low levels from the early 1990s (thus avoiding the observed "boom" in new diesel registrations), and an advanced mitigation scenario based on high proportions of petrol hybrid cars and cars burning gaseous fuels. The difference in CO2-equivalent emissions between the historical case and the scenario avoiding the diesel car boom is only 0.4%. The advanced mitigation scenario would have been able to achieve a 3.4% reduction in total CO2-equivalent emissions over the same time frame. The European diesel car boom appears to have been ineffective at reducing climate-warming emissions from the European transport sector.									5	0	0	0	0	5	0	1	1352-2310	1873-2844		WOS:000455693900012		J	Dotterweich, Markus; Schreg, Rainer								Archaeonics - (Geo)archaeological studies in Anthropogenic Dark Earths (ADE) as an example for future-oriented studies of the past								QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL				502		SI		309	318		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.09.026				JAN 30 2019	2019	This review paper examines the potential of (geo)archaeological data of past human-environment systems to contribute to the development of sustainable land use and soil management strategies. Looking at past land use systems and their socio-economic background extends our understanding of the slow processes and low frequency events that appear to be the key in deciding whether land use systems lead to sustainability or to collapse. As an example, the paper focuses on so-called Anthropogenic Dark Earths (ADE). These highly fertile soils were managed or actively created by ancient cultures in different regions of the world. Since they are rich in humic matter and carbon, and are highly stable to biochemical oxidation, they appear very relevant both as a model for sustainable soil and land management systems and as a tool for climate change mitigation on different scales - local as well as global. The paper argues in favor of a historical perspective to learn about risks and possibilities of land use strategies. We propose a co-adaptive transdisciplinary problem-solving approach ("Archaeonics"), which includes the study of the past as well as respective technical and social implications for the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1040-6182	1873-4553		WOS:000461022000011		J	Kanitkar, Tejal; Banerjee, Rangan; Jayaraman, T.

In this paper, combining a range of modeling methodologies is proposed as a way of addressing these questions in an integrated manner. The choice of models to be used would depend on the specific characteristics of the system and region being studied. One possible combination of models is discusses in this paper for the specific case of India. The Integrated Modeling Framework (IMF) proposed combines three modeling approaches - i) index decomposition to estimate impacts of structural changes in the economy, ii) constrained optimization to estimate least cost fuel options for the power sector, iii) input-output analysis to estimate economic impacts. The model results indicate that the mode of investment for climate change mitigation is a significant determinant of the impact on economic growth, incomes, and income distribution in India. In some scenarios, higher investments in green energy negatively affects low income households significantly more as compared to other households. The paper also demonstrates how the IMF can be used to determine the reasons for and therefore alleviate the negative impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon sequestration potential of Hardwickia binata Roxb. based agroforestry in hot semi-arid environment of India: an assessment of tree density impact								CURRENT SCIENCE				116	1			112	116		10.18520/cs/v116/i1/112-116				JAN 10 2019	2019	Agroforestry is one of the most promising options for climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. However, carbon sequestered in agroforestry system depends on various factors like type of tree species, tree density, system age, soil and climate. One of the most important factors for enhancing carbon sequestration per unit land is tree density. Hardwickia binata Roxb. has been reported as suitable agroforestry tree species with multiple benefits in arid and semi-arid region, however, the role and impact of tree density in carbon sequestration is poorly reported. This study estimated impact of tree density (D-1 = 333 tree ha(-1) and D-2 = 666 tree ha(-1)) on carbon sequestration potential of 30-year-old H. binata Roxb. + Cenchrus setigerus silvipasture system in hot semiarid region of Rajasthan. The carbon sequestered in tree biomass was estimated by reported allometric equations, whereas in soil it was determined by Walkley and Black method. Results showed significant impact of tree density on carbon sequestration per unit tree and per hectare land. The average biomass carbon sequestered by a tree was significantly more (44.5%) in low density (D-1) compared to high density (D-2) system. However, total biomass carbon sequestered per hectare land was significantly more (40.8%) in high density system (31.6 +/- 12.6 Mg C ha(-1)). Carbon sequestered in soil organic matter was higher in both D-1 and D-2 systems compared to control (sole Cenchrus setigerus field). It ranged from 19.93 +/- 0.31 Mg C ha(-1) in control to 22.94 +/- 0.65 Mg C ha(-1) and 23.25 +/- 0.78 Mg C ha(-1) in D-1 and D-2 respectively. The total carbon sequestered (below and above ground tree biomass and soil organic carbon) was in the order D-2 > D-1 > control.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	4	0011-3891			WOS:000455326500026		J	Morgan, Roslyn Elizabeth					Morgan, Roslyn/0000-0002-5300-8378			Determined Action to Tackle Health Determinants: A Collaborative Response to the Challenge of Climate Change Mitigation in Practice Settings								CREATIVE NURSING				25	3			195	200		10.1891/1078-4535.25.3.195				2019	2019	The physical environment has long been understood as a major determinant of health and well-being. In recent years, the relationship between health and the environment has become particularly pronounced, with the impacts of climate change identified as having the potential to reverse the last 50 years of public health advancement (Watts et al., 2015). Increasingly, professional bodies within health care are called upon to frame climate change as a health issue. Despite this, studies have found that nurses report feeling ill-equipped to respond to environmental changes and the resulting health impacts (Anaker, Nilsson, Holmner, & Elf, 2015; Lewis, 2018; Polivka, Chaudry, & Mac Crawford, 2011). This article recognizes some of the barriers facing concerned health-care professionals who wish to introduce climate mitigation activities within their sphere of professional operation. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victorian Branch) was approached by nurses, midwives, and carers, to become more involved in policy debates surrounding climate change and to provide stronger support to members in responding to environmental issues. The result is top-down and bottom-up responses working in synergy for climate change mitigation, by empowering nurses to make changes to their professional practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1078-4535	1946-1895		WOS:000481992500007	31427414	J	Kazeev, Kamil Sh.; Poltoratskaya, Tatyana A.; Yakimova, Anastasia S.; Odobashyan, Mary Yu.; Shkhapatsev, Aslan K.; Kolesnikov, Sergey I.								POST-FIRE CHANGES IN THE BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE BROWN SOILS IN THE UTRISH STATE NATURE RESERVE (RUSSIA)								NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH				4				93	104		10.24189/ncr.2019.055			1	2019	2019	The unique ecosystems of the Abraus peninsula on the Caucasian Black Sea coast persisted in the Utrish State Nature Reserve (Russia), are represented by dry Eastern Mediterranean subtropics with a large number of endemics and relics that have been persisted from the Tertiary period. This is one of the few places in Russia where juniper pistachio (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus) woodlands grow. In 2016-2018, a study was conducted on the content of the biological properties of brown soils in two areas of the Abraus peninsula. The main focus is on the monitoring of Vodopadnaya shchel' on the Utrish State Nature Reserve monitoring site, located in the post-fire area of juniper woodland (Pistacia atlantica, Juniperus excelsa, J. foetidissima, J. oxycedrus) at an altitude of 110-140 m a.s.l. on the southern spurs of the Ridge Navagir. The fire happened in 2009. Additionally, in April 2018, the site of the burnt area of 2013 was investigated in the immediate vicinity of the Sukhaya shchel' of the Utrish State Nature Reserve. The area of the burnt site was several hectares including violation of terrestrial vegetation and changes in the ecological state of the soil. We have demonstrated that brown soils are rare for Russia (Cromic Cambisol and Cromi-Leptic Luvisol according to the WRB international classification). But these are widespread in most parts of the Abraus peninsula, including the Utrish State Nature Reserve. The main features of brown soils include the brown colour of the soil profile; intense textural lining of the middle part of the soil profile; eluvial-illuvial type of decarbonisation closed to neutral reaction of the environment; soil richness with elements of mineral nutrition. The studied soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve are characterised by higher stoniness and rubble, no carbonate growths, fragmentation of the forest floor due to the low-mountain dissected relief of the territory. We have studied the ecological and biological properties of these soils in response to fire (e.g. temperature, moisture, soil bulk density, organic carbon and carbonate content, bacteria abundance, catalase, peroxidase, dehydrogenase, and invertase activities). In the grass-shrub stage, the restorative succession was in both burnt areas. The fire had a significant effect on the ecological and biological properties of brown soils 5-9 years after the fire impact. Many of the biological properties of post-fire soils differed significantly in comparison with the properties of control areas of juniper light forest. The organic carbon content and biological activity of post-fire soils as a whole are reduced as compared with the soils of control areas of juniper light forest. In this case, a high variation of the biological parameters of the soil was noted in different parts of the same burnt area. The variation is associated both with the peculiarities of the mountain relief, and with the nature of the vegetation, which forms refugia different in the number of plant residues. The rate of carbon dioxide production in the surface horizons of the burnt area soil is more than 2 times lower than the values in control areas. Five years after the fire, the post-fire soil of the Sukhaya shchel' area contained almost half of the humus content at the 5 cm surface layer compared to the soil of the control area of juniper woodlands. At a depth of 15-25 cm, the difference between the soils areas remained at the same level as for the upper horizons.Thus, we demonstrated a significant effect of fires on the biological parameters of the subtropical soils in the Utrish State Nature Reserve, which has been persisted for many years.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2500-008X			WOS:000480408500008		B	Mulumba, Kaniki J.; Langerman, Kristy E.; Marnewick, Annlize L.			IEEE					Determining the optimal energy use mix in a low-income household								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 TWENTY SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF ENERGY (DUE)								25	33						2019	2019	Energy use is crucial to our way of living and is fundamental for sustainable development, but often negatively affects human health and the environment. Around 60 percent of low-income households on the South African Highveld rely on solid fuels to meet their energy needs (cooking, water heating and space heating, especially in winter), despite being electrified. The aim of this research is to optimise energy use mix in a typical low-income household on the Highveld for least cost, lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and lowest particulate matter (with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m - PM10) emissions. The study employs secondary data from Eskom's air quality offsets pilot project in KwaZamokuhle and other studies on energy use patterns. The energy requirements and constraints for an insulated, formal house are expressed as linear programming problems. The solutions reveal that using coal for cooking, space and water heating, and electricity for lighting and appliances, is the least cost option. However, for lowest CO2 and PM10 emissions, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is most suitable for cooking, space heating and water heating, and electricity is preferred for lighting and appliances. These findings suggest that policies and initiatives that encourage LPG and electricity use should improve air quality in low-income communities and aid in climate change mitigation, but will not be sustainable unless the LPG or electricity is affordable for households.					27th International Conference on the Domestic Use of Energy (DUE)27th International Conference on the Domestic Use of Energy (DUE)	MAR 25-27, 2019MAR 25-27, 2019	Cape Peninsula Univ Technol; IEEE IAS Chapter; IEEE IES Chapter; IEEE PELS Chapter; IEEE Power & Energy Soc Chapter; S African Assoc Energy Serv Co; S African Inst Elect Engineers; Assoc Municipal Elect Undertakings; So Assoc Energy Efficiency; Sustainable Energy Soc So Africa; Natl Energy Efficiency Agcy; Univ Stellenbosch; Univ Cape Town; N W Univ; Eskom; City Cape TownCape Peninsula Univ Technol; IEEE IAS Chapter; IEEE IES Chapter; IEEE PELS Chapter; IEEE Power & Energy Soc Chapter; S African Assoc Energy Serv Co; S African Inst Elect Engineers; Assoc Municipal Elect Undertakings; So Assoc Energy Efficiency; Sustainable Energy Soc So Africa; Natl Energy Efficiency Agcy; Univ Stellenbosch; Univ Cape Town; N W Univ; Eskom; City Cape Town	Wellington, SOUTH AFRICAWellington, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			978-0-6399647-3-7	WOS:000477745600007		J	Morgunov, B.A.; Terentiev, A.A.; Kozeltsev, M.L.

Ongoing environmental changes have transboundary nature and will have significant impact in international scale. In case of overlapping of factors of impact their nature and synergetic effect, mechanisms of their interrelated influence and possible negative consequences for global economy, environment and human health are not adequately known. Among the main obstacles to mitigation of climate change impact on the state of big river basins in the Arctic and Arctic seas are: the lack of critically important information and data, absence of modern concepts of climate change mitigation measures connected with impact on Arctic seas, uncoordinated and inefficient regulation and management, absence of unified interstate tools of marine spatial planning. The article contains the analysis of risks and global consequences of the ongoing climate change for water resources; characteristic of priority issues and their underlying root causes. It also contains the results of the analysis of risks connected with melting of permafrost and increase in thermal coast erosion, assessment of the role of transboundary cooperation in the Arctic for sustainable regional development. The authors also propose some measures for addressing the above issues based on the Strategic Program of Actions on the Protection of the Russian Part of the Arctic developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.			В условиях изменения климата современные вызовы и угрозы устойчивому развитию, включая безопасное использование трансграничных ресурсов рек и морей Арктики, связаны с совокупным влиянием многих факторов. Происходящие экологические изменения носят трансграничный характер и окажут существенное влияние в международном масштабе. Характер и синергетический эффект при наложении факторов воздействия, механизмы их взаимосвязанного влияния и возможные негативные последствия изменений климата для мировой экономики, окружающей природной среды и здоровья населения изучены недостаточно. Основными препятствиями на пути смягчения их влияния на состояние бассейнов крупных северных рек и морей Арктики являются: недостаточность информации и данных об их современном состоянии, отсутствие адекватных концепций смягчения влияния климатических изменений на морские экосистемы Арктики; несогласованное и недостаточно эффективное регулирование и управление; отсутствие унифицированного межстранового механизма пространственного планирования морским природопользованием.

On the other hand, the tar, generated from woody biomass combustion, condenses and accumulates in the combustion chamber resulting in a reduction of heat transfer on the surface where heat exchange takes place, which decreases the thermal efficiency and equipment life span. To solve these problems, an additive acting as a catalyst for a reforming reaction was mixed with the pellets to reduce tar formation in combustion. For the experiment, 2% of dolomite, 2% of limestone and 1% mixture of dolomite and limestone were added as catalysts to the wood pellets. The experiments were conducted in the same external environment and a comparison of the thermal efficiency and reduction of tar of boiler containing the solid additive was carried out. As a result, the thermal efficiency of the additive pellets was increased by 1.09% and 0.36% for dolomite 2%, limestone 1% and dolomite 1%, respectively, compared to conventional wood pellets, and decreased by 0.46 for 2% lime stone. Although the thermal efficiency of the dolomite 2% additive pellets was the highest,pellets with 1% dolomite and 1% limestone produced the best result.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1738-3935			KJD:ART002474482		J	Scherer, Dieter; Antretter, Florian; Benders, Steffen; Cortekar, Joerg; Emeis, Stefan; Fehrenbach, Ute; Gross, Guenter; Halbig, Guido; Hasse, Jens; Maronga, Bioern; Raasch, Siegfried; Scherber, Katharina					Emeis, Stefan/0000-0001-6114-6212; Cortekar, Jorg/0000-0001-7774-0179			Urban Climate Under Change [UC](2) - A National Research Programme for Developing a Building-Resolving Atmospheric Model for Entire City Regions								METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT				28	2			95	104		10.1127/metz/2019/0913				2019	2019	Large cities and urban regions are confronted with rising pressure by environmental pollution, impacts of climate change, as well as natural and health hazards. They are characterised by heterogeneous mosaics of urban structures, causing modifications of atmospheric processes on different temporal and spatial scales. Planning authorities need reliable, locally relevant information on urban atmospheric processes, providing fine spatial resolutions in city quarters or street canyons, as well as projections of future climates, specifically downscaled to individual cities. Therefore, building-resolving urban climate models for entire city regions are required as a tool for urban development and planning, air quality control, as well as for design of actions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. To date, building-resolving atmospheric models covering entire large cities are mostly missing. The German research programme "Urban Climate Under Change" ([UC](2)) aims at developing a new urban climate model, acquiring three-dimensional observational data for model testing and validation, and testing its practicability and usability in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to provide a scientifically sound and practicable instrument to address the above mentioned challenges. This article provides an outline of the collaborative activities of the [UC](2) research programme.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	0941-2948	1610-1227		WOS:000472620600001		S	Tronchin, Lamberto; Manfren, Massimiliano; Nastasi, Benedetto				Nastasi, Benedetto/F-2013-2015	Nastasi, Benedetto/0000-0003-1713-6548; Manfren, Massimiliano/0000-0003-1438-970X	Salame, CT; Aillerie, M; Papageorgas, P; Perilhon, C; Haider, A; Vokas, G; Shaban, A; Jabur, A		Energy analytics for supporting built environment decarbonisation								TECHNOLOGIES AND MATERIALS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY (TMREES)		Energy Procedia		157				1486	1493		10.1016/j.egypro.2018.11.313				2019	2019	The identification of techno-economically feasible decarbonisation paths and sustainability transitions for the built environment is a necessary task for research today and building stock renovation processes can act in synergy with innovative economic and technological development paradigms to achieve different types of benefits such as economic growth and employment, together with resource efficiency and sustainability for the whole sector. The research presented aims at selecting the most relevant data analysis processes and techniques to respond to practical technical questions and to support decision-making in the built environment, at multiple scales of analysis, from individual buildings, to building stock and urban environment. The research aims to indicate in this way the possibility to join the micro-scale view, involving technological and behavioral issues in buildings, and the macro-scale view, involving strategic problems at market and policy levels for energy and sustainability planning. Further, the combined use of modelling techniques with large scale data acquisition and processing could guarantee multiple feed-backs from measured data, useful for the evolution, first of all, of design and operation practices in building but also, more in general, of the whole value chain of the sector. A synthesis and integration of modelling methodologies is presented through case studies, showing a path to improve transparency of performance assessment across building life cycle phases. Finally, multivariate data visualization techniques are presented to ease wider applicability of the described numerical techniques. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study develops a methodological framework to quantify carbon credits from carbon-oriented forest management and evaluates the economic sustainability of their sale. Application of the framework to two forest compartments with long-lasting active management in the Western Italian Alps showed the feasibility of the methodology and provided insights on its replication in other contexts. Particularly, the Carbon-oriented scenario led to a reduction of both the extracted wood volume (10% and 6.5% CASE1 and CASE2, respectively) and Net Present Value (32% and 29%), leading to a carbon credit price of 19.6 (sic) MgCO2eq-1 and 44.1 (sic) MgCO2eq-1 to counteract these losses.This work allows us to highlight the factors needed to design and evaluate alternative forest management options while considering the consequences of climate change. Moreover, the hypothesized scenarios include an economic remuneration of the positive externalities provided by sustainable forest management.Finally, the proposed workflow entails undeniable environmental benefits while contrasting climate change but still looks undesirable with respect to the traditional timber-oriented management in compartments where high-quality wood products can be obtained.									4	0	0	1	0	4	4	4	1054-9811	1540-756X		WOS:000469952600003		J	서형준; 이형석								A Global Malmquist Analysis on Efficiency of Greenhouse Gas Emission for 16 Local Governments - Focusing on Green productivity -			16개 광역지자체 온실가스배출 효율성에 대한 글로벌맘퀴스트 분석 - 녹색생산성을 중심으로 -					Seoul Studies	서울도시연구			20	1			19	32						2019	2019	In 2015, Korea government pledged to cut business as usual (BAU) carbon emissions by 37 compared to BAU(Business as usual). Since local governments are in charge of monitoring greenhouse gas emission, their responsibility to greenhouse gas reduction also has increased. However, greenhouse gas reduction policy has negative impact for regional economy, thus, a point of compromise is required between environment and growth. In this study, we analyzed green productivity for 16 local governments to draw optimal green productivity performance from 2009 to 2013. Energy consumption, labor and capital were selected as input variables, while GRDP and greenhousegas emission volume were selected as output variables. From these variables, we obtained green productivity performance by adopting Global Malmquist Index based on non-radial distance function. This index was also decomposed into two indexes; Efficiency change(EC) and Best practice change(BPC). We found every province shows uptrend except Daegu, Gwangju and Jeju when it comes to Green productivity performance, and Chungbuk shows the highest value. In EC, Chungbuk also shows the highest value implicating it is the closest DMU to optimal frontier while Incheon and Jeonbuk whose EC shows less than 1 vice versa. In BPC, Ulsan shows the best performance implicating technological progress while Gwangju, Daegu, Daejeon and Jeju shows technological regression.				2015년 정부는 2030년까지 국가 온실가스 감축목표를 배출전망치(BAU) 대비 37% 감축하는 것을 확정하였다. 이에 따라 실질적으로 온실가스 배출을 감독하는 각 지자체의 책임이 증대되고 있다. 하지만 온실가스 감축정책은 지역경제성장에 부정적 영향을 초래할 수 있기 때문에 환경과 성장 사이에 타협점이 필요하다. 이 연구는 2009년부터 2013년간 주요 광역 16개 지자체를 대상으로 녹색생산성을 분석해 최적의 효율성을 도출하고자 하였다. 에너지Â·노동Â·자본을 투입물로 하고, 지역내총생산과 온실가스 배출량을 산출물로 하여 방향거리 함수와 글로벌맘퀴스트 지수를 활용해 녹색생산성과 효율성변화 수치, 기술변화 수치를 계산하였다. 녹색생산성은 대구Â·광주Â·제주를 제외한 모든 지역이 증가세를 나타낸 가운데 충북이 가장 높은 수치를 기록했다. 효율성변화 수치도 충북이 1위를 차지하며 최적의 생산변경에 접근한 것으로 분석됐고, 경남Â·충남Â·인천Â·전북은 1에 미치지 못해 생산변경에서 멀어지는 것으로 확인됐다. 기술변화 수치는 울산이 평균적으로 가장 높은 기술진보 수준을 보인 반면, 광주Â·대구Â·대전Â·제주는 기술이 퇴보한 것으로 조사됐다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1738-7124			KJD:ART002465002		J	Wang, Bing; Cui, Chao-Qun; Zhao, Yi-Xin; Chen, Man; Yuan, Xiao-Chen								Climate change mitigation in the coal mining industry: low-carbon pathways and mine safety indicators								NATURAL HAZARDS				95	1-2	SI		25	38		10.1007/s11069-018-3438-1				JAN 2019	2019	As China's major energy source, the coal sector contributes to a significant portion of China's greenhouse gas emissions, and the industry faces huge pressure in relation to saving energy and reducing carbon emissions. Considering Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database as the basic retrieval source, this paper presents the status and hot spots reported in studies on the carbon emissions of the coal mining industry. The results reveal that the scientific outcomes of these studies in this field have increased sharply in the last 5 years. China University of Mining and Technology and the China Coal Research Institute are outstanding research institutes regarding this research topic. The subject distribution suggested the studies on the carbon emissions of the coal mining sector have developed into an interdisciplinary field, which includes the coal mining technology, industrial economy, management and environment. The related hot spots indicate that the energy consumed during the mining process, coal mine gas, sustainable plans for abandoned coal mines and utilization of coal gangue are the indexes for low-carbon development of the coal mining industry, which is also significant for mine disaster prevention. It should be highlighted that the coal spontaneous combustion during the coal mining process and the coal production structure represented by the number of coal mines and the minimum capacity requirement could be important factors for achieving future carbon emission reductions in the coal mining sector.									1	0	0	0	0	1	12	15	0921-030X	1573-0840		WOS:000464319300003		J	Eisenberg, Ann M.								JUST TRANSITIONS								SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW				92	2			273	330						JAN 2019	2019	The transition to a low-carbon society will have winners and losers as the costs and benefits of decarbonization fall unevenly on different communities. This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a "just transition" to a green economy. While the term, "just transition," is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential.The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of "just transition." I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a "superfund for workers." In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept.I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and "jobs-versus-environment" tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.									0	0	0	0	0	0	8	9	0038-3910			WOS:000462744600002		J	Oei, Pao-Yu; Mendelevitch, Roman					Oei, Pao-Yu/0000-0001-6638-0147; Mendelevitch, Roman/0000-0001-5054-109X			Prospects for steam coal exporters in the era of climate policies: a case study of Colombia								CLIMATE POLICY				19	1			73	91		10.1080/14693062.2018.1449094				2019	2019	Continued global action on climate change has major consequences for fossil fuel markets, especially for coal as the most carbon-intensive fuel. This article summarizes current market developments in the most important coal-producing and coal-consuming countries, resulting in a critical qualitative assessment of prospects for future coal exports. Colombia, as the world's fourth largest exporter, is strongly affected by these global trends, with more than 90% of its production being exported. Market analysis finds Colombia in a strong competitive position, owing to its low production costs and high coal quality. Nevertheless, market trends and enhanced climate policies suggest a gloomy outlook for future exports. Increasing competition on the Atlantic as well as Pacific market will keep coal prices low and continue pressure on mining companies. Increasing numbers of filed bankruptcies and lay-offs might be just the beginning of a carbon bubble devaluing fossil fuel investments and leaving them stranded. Colombia largely supplies European and Mediterranean consumers but also delivers some quantities to the US Gulf Coast, and to Central and South America. Future coal demand in most of these countries will continue to decline in the next decades. Newly constructed power plants in emerging economies (India, China) are unlikely to compensate for this downturn owing to increasing domestic supply and decreasing demand. Therefore, maintaining or even increasing mining volumes in Colombia should be re-evaluated, taking into account new economic realities as well as local externalities. Ignoring these risks could lead to additional stranded investments, aggravating the local resource curse and hampering sustainable economic development.Key policy insights The climate policies of most of Colombia's traditional trade partners target steam coal as the more emission-intensive fossil fuel, with many countries implementing or considering a coal phase-out.Coal exporters should re-evaluate their operations and new investments taking into account this new policy environment.To prevent a race to the bottom among coal producers that would favour weak regulation, climate policy makers should also consider the local social and external costs of coal mining, including on health and the local environment.									5	0	0	1	0	5	1	1	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000461787900006		S	Tica, G.; Grubic, A.

Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on December 6, 2000. In its status as non-Annex I country within the UNFCCC, Bosnia and Herzegovina is obliged to undertake the following reporting activities, such as: to calculate annual emissions of greenhouse gases using a defined methodology and reporting to the Conference of the Parties (COP), introduce and implement measures to mitigate the effects of climate change by regulating anthropogenic emissions and adaptation measures to climate change. Also cooperates in the development and transfer of technology, methods and processes that lead to limitation, reduction and stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions, include an impact assessment of climate change and appropriate economic development strategies and policies aimed at minimizing the negative impacts of climate change on the economy, the environment and the health of the population; conduct systematic observation and research, exchange data and exchange information on climate and climate change in order to improve scientific discoveries on the causes and consequences of climate change. This project not only supports the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fulfilling the above obligations as a signatory to the UNFCCC, but will also serve as an important strategic document for sustainable development. Also, this project promotes relations between entities and business sectors, establishing links between the environment and other sectors. The data on the emission of F-gases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including sources of these gases, are provided. In this paper, potentially intrusive measures are suggested. Ozone is a gas located in the earth's atmosphere in a layer of 15 to 35 km above the Earth and has a special significance for the planets and the entire life on it. It is very important his role for the protection of life on Earth, and the disrupted occurrences of ozone flows through the atmosphere can have harmful effects on the health of man and the environment as a whole. The amount of ozone in the tropospheric (in the first lower layer above the Earth) and the tratospheric (upper-upper layer) was in the past in a natural balance. Uncontrolled human activity, in particular the development of the refrigeration industry, and the accelerated increase in the emissions of individual industrial gases, there was an increase in ozone levels in the tropospheric layer and in the stratospheric reduction. Concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and troposphere is limited by the balance between the chemical processes produced by ozone and the processes that destroy it. This equilibrium of the process is determined and depends on the amount of gases (involved in the reaction) and the speed (or efficiency of individual reactions), depending on the intensity of sunlight, location and area in the atmosphere, temperature and other natural climate factors. Global ozone has declined steadily over the last few decades. The Earth's stratosphere has increased the amount of reactive gases, containing chlorine and bromine. The biggest impact on climate change is the carbon dioxide emission CO2, due to the far-reaching emissions (measured in billions of tonnes per year).Among the "greenhouse gases" with the far-reaching "global warming potential" (GWP) are the so-called "Ozone gases" or substances that damage the ozone layer CFC and HCFC. Fortunately, there is a far smaller amount of these gases that reaches the atmosphere than CO2.

Despite the efforts made by governmental and non-governmental organizations in forming and supporting water user associations, little is known about their role on water resource management in the country. This study aimed to investigate the role of water user associations on the restoration of decreased environmental flow and degraded aquatic ecosystems in Tanzania, taking the Mkoji sub-catchment as a case study. Six water user associations were assessed, focusing on their strategies and influence on restoration, land use, ecosystem degradation, and their role in climate change mitigation strategies. Data were collected from various sources using interviews, focus group discussions and questionnaires. The Spearman correlation test was used to seek the relationship between the flow and the aquatic ecosystem. Statistical results showed that there was no correlation between the flow and rainfall, and there was a correlation between freshwater ecosystems and the flow. The results showed that 89% of the sample population accepted the decrease of the flow while 75% accepted the decrease of the fish catch in the freshwater ecosystem of the study. Based on the results obtained, the paper concluded that water user associations are doing a great job in management and restoration while politics, funding, and water permits were the main obstacles. Therefore, the government should play a role in restoring the ecosystem, bridging the gaps between farmers and animal keepers, land use planning, and developing aquaculture.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	1	2073-4441			WOS:000459735100139		J	Gullberg, Anne Therese; Aardal, Bernt					Aardal, Bernt/0000-0002-3662-9762			Is climate change mitigation compatible with environmental protection? Exploring voter attitudes as expressed through "old" and "new" politics in Norway								ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE				29	1			67	80		10.1002/eet.1844				JAN-FEB 2019	2019	The international literature on public attitudes finds that attitudes to climate change are closely related to attitudes to environmental protection. We ask whether this conclusion also holds for Norway. Our starting point is the political science literature on "old" versus "new" politics, old politics being defined in socio-economic left or right terms and new politics being defined in accordance with an authoritarian or libertarian dimension in which environmental protection plays an important role. Based on these two axes, Herbert Kitschelt finds a new axis-a diagonal-combining old and new divides. According to Kitschelt, voters with traditional environmental attitudes have leftist and libertarian values, while voters favouring economic growth have rightist and authoritarian values. Using Norwegian data, we compare voters who favour traditional environmental protection and take climate change seriously with voters who only take climate change seriously. We expect that if climate change is perceived as one of many environmental threats, then the two voter groups are similar. We find that half of the voters see climate change as a big problem. Two thirds of these voters are in favour of environmental protection. However, the last third of these voters who take climate change seriously do not want greater environmental protection. Moreover, we find interesting differences between these groups. Those in the latter group have leftist and libertarian values, whereas climate-only voters have rightist and authoritarian values. Thus the two groups of voters are dissimilar. Interestingly, this pattern corresponds to alignments along Kitschelt's new diagonal axis for party competition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	1756-932X	1756-9338		WOS:000458371400007		J	Daioglou, Vassilis; Doelman, Jonathan C.; Wicke, Birka; Faaij, Andre; van Vuuren, Detlef P.

Furthermore, it can be used in combination with carbon capture and storage to provide so-called "negative emissions". At the same time, however, its production will require land, possibly impacting food security, land-based carbon stocks, and other environmental services. Thus, the strategies adopted in the supply, conversion, and use of biomass have a significant impact on its effectiveness as a climate change mitigation measure. We use the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model to project three different global, long term scenarios spanning different socioeconomic futures with varying rates of population growth, economic growth, and technological change, and investigate the role of biomass in meeting strict climate targets. Using these scenarios we highlight different possibilities for biomass supply and demand, and provide insights on the requirements and challenges for the effective use of this resource as a climate change mitigation measure. The results show that in scenarios meeting the 1.5 degrees C target, biomass could exceed 20% of final energy consumption, or 115-180 EJ(Prim)/yr in 2050. Such a supply of bioenergy can only be achieved without extreme levels land use change if agricultural yields improve significantly and effective land zoning is implemented. Furthermore, the results highlight that strict mitigation targets are contingent on the availability of advanced technologies such as lignocellulosic fuels and carbon capture and storage.									5	0	0	1	0	5	13	17	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000458468400010		J	Schwartz, Elizabeth								Autonomous Local Climate Change Policy: An Analysis of the Effect of Intergovernmental Relations Among Subnational Governments								REVIEW OF POLICY RESEARCH				36	1			50	74		10.1111/ropr.12320				JAN 2019	2019	Local governments have emerged as important players in climate change governance, both at home and on the international stage. Likewise, action by states and provinces has been increasingly highlighted, particularly as national actors have moved slowly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But to what extent do local governments act independently from state and provincial governments in the area of climate change mitigation? Using an explicit process tracing approach, the article tests two hypotheses regarding the influence of upper level subnational governments on local policy. In Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a city that is a climate change leader, provincial government intervention cannot explain the results of climate change mitigation policy making. This suggests that local governments can exercise an important degree of autonomy over climate change policy, but also implies that where municipalities are less independently committed to climate action, active upper level government intervention will likely be needed.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	3	1541-132X	1541-1338		WOS:000455958900003		J	Khan, Sikandar; Khulief, Yehia Abel; Al-Shuhail, Abdullatif				AL-SHUHAIL, ABDULLATIF/C-1614-2015	AL-SHUHAIL, ABDULLATIF/0000-0002-2171-0154			Mitigating climate change via CO2 sequestration into Biyadh reservoir: geomechanical modeling and caprock integrity								MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE				24	1			23	52		10.1007/s11027-018-9792-1				JAN 2019	2019	Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can cause severe global climatic changes, which may include an increase in the global temperature, rise of the sea level, increase in wildfire, floods, and storms, in addition to changes in the amount of rain and snow. The global mitigation strategies that can be envisioned to reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere include retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient systems, increasing the dependency on renewable energy sources in lieu of fossil fuels, increasing the use of sustainable transportation systems that rely on electricity and biofuels, and adopting globally more sustainable uses of land and forests. To reduce global climatic changes, the excess amount of carbon dioxide in the environment needs to be captured and stored in deep underground sedimentary reservoirs. The sedimentary reservoirs that contain water in the rock matrix provide a more secure CO2 sequestration medium. The injection of carbon dioxide causes a huge increase in the reservoir pore pressure and provokes the subsequent ground uplift. The excessive increase in pore pressure may also cause leakage of carbon dioxide into the potable water layers and to the atmosphere, thus leading to severe global climatic changes. In order to maintain the integrity of the sequestration process, it is crucial to inject a safe quantity of carbon dioxide into the sequestration site. Accordingly, the injection period and the safe values of injection parameters, like flow rate and injection pressure, need to be calculated a priori to ensure that the stored carbon dioxide will not leak into the atmosphere and jeopardize the climate mitigation strategy. To model carbon dioxide injection in reservoirs having a base fluid, such as water, one has to perform a two-phase flow modeling for both the injected and base fluids. In the present investigation, carbon dioxide is injected into Biyadh reservoir, wherein the two-phase flow through the reservoir structure is taken into account. This investigation aims to estimate the safe parameter values for carbon dioxide injection into the Biyadh reservoir, in order to avoid leakage of carbon dioxide through the caprock. In this context, the two cases of a fractured and non-fractured caprock are considered. To ensure a safe sequestration mechanism, the coupled reservoir stability analysis is performed to estimate the safe values of the injection parameters, thus furnishing data for a reliable global climate change mitigation strategy. The obtained results demonstrated that the injection of carbon dioxide has caused a maximum pore pressure increase of 25MPa and a ground uplift of 35mm.									0	0	0	0	0	0	10	23	1381-2386	1573-1596		WOS:000454953400002		J	Warren, R.

Next, we demonstrate the application of the framework to produce policy-relevant scientific information. We use it to show that when using carbon price mechanisms to induce a transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy, prices can be minimised if policy action is taken early, if burden sharing regimes are used, and if agriculture is intensified.

To fill this gap, this article presents a new approach for calculating the carbon handprint of products. The core of the suggested approach involves comparing the carbon footprint of an improved product with the carbon footprint of the baseline product, and subsequently calculating the reduction in greenhouse gas emission that can be achieved by utilizing the improved product. The proposed approach is founded on the standardized life cycle assessment methodology for footprints until the use stage, and it provides a framework to recognize the effects of the remaining life cycle stages in the actual operational environment. This calculation is meant to be used by manufacturers that wish to show potential customers the positive climate impacts offered by the manufacturer's product. The carbon handprint approach complements the existing methodologies by introducing new definitions and consistent guidelines for comparing the baseline product and the improved product.This article presents the developed calculation approach and demonstrates the approach with one case study about renewable diesel. Results of the diesel handprint calculation indicate that a driver can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by choosing renewable diesel over baseline fuel. Thus, the producer of the renewable diesel will create a handprint.Organizations can use carbon handprints for quantifying the greenhouse gas reductions their customers can achieve by utilizing the product. Thus, the carbon handprint can be a powerful tool in communications and marketing. By conducting carbon handprint assessments, a company can also find out how their product qualifies in comparison to baseline products. Therefore, carbon handprints can also support decision-making and lifelong product design. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Transitioning to a cost-effective and carbon-neutral energy system in Nigeria and across the globe by the second half of this century is vital. This study explores a paradigmatic pathway to a fully sustainable energy system for Nigeria, by 2050. The research approach is to simulate a cost-optimised transition pathway towards 100% renewable energy based power system for Nigeria, using a linear optimisation model. The model is based on hourly resolution for an entire year. The country researched is structured into 6 sub-regions. The optimisation for each of the 5-year time periods is carried out based on assumed costs and technological status until 2050 for all energy technologies involved. The levelised cost of electricity declines from 54 (sic)/MWh in 2015 to 46 (sic)/MWh in 2050 for the power sector in the Best Policy Scenario and further declines to 35 (sic)/MWh with sector coupling. Whereas, the cost of electricity increased to 75 (sic)/MWh in the Current Policy Scenario without greenhouse gas emission cost. The results clearly reveal that integrating a renewable energy technology mix with a wide variety of storage technologies is the most competitive and least cost electricity option for Nigeria in the mid-term future, as indicated by the Best Policy Scenario. In particular, the compatibility and predominant role of solar photovoltaics and batteries is paramount towards a rapid transition of Nigeria's power sector, due to highly favourable economics. This study concludes with the implications of a stable and supportive policy environment, transitioning to a defossiliated energy system in Nigeria could be achieved in the mid-term future. This study is the first of its kind in full hourly resolution for Nigeria, and demonstrates the need for carrying out detailed analyses in examining gaps in energy transition understanding based on various policy constraints for developing countries in comparable climates.									2	0	0	0	0	2	5	9	0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000452345900004		J	Sobrosa Neto, Ruy de Castro; Berchin, Issa Ibrahim; Magtoto, Mica; Berchin, Stephanie; Xavier, Wlamir Goncalves; Osorio de Andrade Guerra, Jose Baltazar Salgueirinho				Guerra, Jose Baltazar S.

These changes aligned with the consequent change in dietary behaviors through an increased consumption of meat and a preference for sustainability standards of production, demand new technologies and techniques. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to propose a beef cattle production model based on a sustainable integrative approach to the WEF nexus, addressing water savings through rainwater collection, food production, and clean and renewable energy generation (solar cells and biodigesters). In addition, cattle are provided thermal comfort and welfare. The proposed model was tested in a beef cattle production environment and the benefits of this sustainable integrative approach were analyzed. Findings suggest that the proposed standard modules represent a strategic option for livestock producers. The use of the photovoltaic solar cells shadow improve the welfare and quality of cattle production, while generating clean and renewable energy and providing water savings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change adaptation involves strategics of adjusting to the negative effects of climate change, while climate change mitigation involves techniques that help to reduce production of greenhouse gases through burning fossil fuels. The African worldview from the frontier of Nigerian epistemological and ontological perspectives as it finds expression in climate change adaptation and mitigation is built on the foundations of its relationship with nature, traditional religion and belief systems, agricultural practices, and some other day-to-day practices. Worldview analysis of the contemporary Nigerian has been conducted and classified into Original African. Westernized African. and Little Here-and-There African. a paradigm existing in Nigerians irrespective of level of Western education. What will be the fate of the younger Nigerian climate scientist in a globalized and technologically competitive world?

Although a complex problem demands complex solutions, barriers to interdisciplinary visions and intersectoral coordination persist. Particularly, office-based projects (paper) rarely reach the implementation stage (action), while few contemplate the synergies between mitigation and adaptation. This article analyses climate change plans and programs for the coffee sector considering the coffee rust epidemic, a disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix which has generated important losses to coffee production since the 2012/2013 cycle. Structural problems created ideal conditions for this disease which has been associated with climate change, whilst the institutional response has generated new challenges for coffee producing communities who live in biodiversity hotspots like the Chiapas Sierra Madre in southern Mexico. We discuss the synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation by analyzing the campaign in favor of carbon stocks and biodiversity in shade-grown coffee plantations of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Designed in response to the current coffee rust epidemic, this campaign emphasizes deforestation, forest degradation and loss of ecosystem services that is associated with the current crisis of shade-grown coffee, with proposals set out to benefit both ecosystems and the coffee communities. We identify three challenges which mark the distance between paper and action, as exemplified in the case of the coffee crisis in the Chiapas Sierra Madre.									0	0	0	0	0	0	4	11	2448-7597			WOS:000456799200012		J	Antal, Miklos				Antal, Miklos/I-6328-2017	Antal, Miklos/0000-0003-3426-9916			Post-growth strategies can be more feasible than techno-fixes: Focus on working time								ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW				5	3			230	236		10.1177/2053019618794212				DEC 2018	2018	For sufficiently fast climate change mitigation, strategies once considered unthinkable have to be discussed.

BUILDING SIMULATION				11	6			1273	1288		10.1007/s12273-018-0463-7				DEC 2018	2018	Neighborhood has always been of significant interest to built environment stockholders as a basic planning unit. However, any discussion in these concerns, without drawing attention to sustainable microclimate approaches, would still in a mess at a time of increasing population and climate change. Emergence of the sustainable development concept at the mid-20th century and its emphasis led to increasing crucial role that the urban green infrastructure along with reflective materials can play in mitigating neighborhood microclimate's symptoms of climate change. Considering the lack of studies for urban heat island (UHI) in hot arid regions, particularly in Egypt and the limited number of studies concerning the numerical simulation of all mitigation strategies incorporated, this research studies the mitigation of UHI phenomenon in a case study in Cairo in present and future (2020, 2050 and 2080) through applying the criteria of tree lines, green roofs, high albedo pavements and shading structures within the neighborhood sustainability assessment tool (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood; LEED-ND). The microclimatic numerical CFD simulations of ENVI-met 4.0 was used following the measurement of LAI and Albedo of selected Egyptian trees to assess UHI through air and radiant temperature differences before and after applying mitigation strategies. Results demonstrate a considerable ability to acclimatize the microclimate in terms of better conditions in present and future.									1	1	0	0	0	1	7	27	1996-3599	1996-8744		WOS:000451924600015		J	Neves, Sonia Almeida; Marques, Antonio Cardoso; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto				Marques, Antonio C./D-2235-2011; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto/P-1603-2017; Neves, Sonia Almeida/T-8303-2017	Marques, Antonio C./0000-0002-9906-3874; Fuinhas, Jose Alberto/0000-0002-6937-5420; Neves, Sonia Almeida/0000-0002-0079-9620			Could alternative energy sources in the transport sector decarbonise the economy without compromising economic growth?								ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY				20		SI		23	40		10.1007/s10668-018-0153-8			1	DEC 2018	2018	The transition towards a low-carbon transport sector (TS) plays a fundamental role on the decarbonisation of economies. The effects of both conventional (fossil fuels) and alternative (renewable fuels and electricity) energy consumption in the transport sector, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions were analysed by using a panel vector autoregressive of 21 high-income Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from 1990 to 2014. The results support the feedback hypothesis between both conventional and alternative TS energy sources and economic growth. In other words, electricity use on TS has enlarged the economic growth, while consumption of renewable fuels is actually hampering it. Additionally, TS fossil fuels consumption is contributing to economic growth. With reference to the environmental impacts of TS energy use, this paper highlights the harmful effect of conventional energy sources on the environment. However, there is no evidence wherein TS alternative energy sources are directly linked with a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Accordingly, the promotion of alternative TS energy sources should deserve further attention. On the one hand, there is evidence that the use of renewable fuels is obstructing economic growth. On the other hand, the use of both TS electricity and renewable fuels is not reducing carbon dioxide emissions.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	7	1387-585X	1573-2975		WOS:000449886800003		J	Thaker, Maria; Zambre, Amod; Bhosale, Harshal					Zambre, Amod/0000-0002-0054-5532			Wind farms have cascading impacts on ecosystems across trophic levels								NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION				2	12			1854	1858		10.1038/s41559-018-0707-z				DEC 2018	2018	Wind farms are a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels for mitigating the effects of climate change, but they also have complex ecological consequences. In the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats in India, we find that wind farms reduce the abundance and activity of predatory birds (for example, Buteo, Butastur and Elanus species), which consequently increases the density of lizards, Sarada superba. The cascading effects of wind turbines on lizards include changes in behaviour, physiology and morphology that reflect a combination of predator release and density-dependent competition. By adding an effective trophic level to the top of food webs, we find that wind farms have emerging impacts that are greatly underestimated. There is thus a strong need for an ecosystem-wide view when aligning green-energy goals with environment protection.									1	0	0	1	0	2	11	27	2397-334X			WOS:000450904100011	30397304	J	Goeswein, Verena; Krones, Jonathan; Celentano, Giulia; Fernandez, John E.; Habert, Guillaume				, Habert/Q-3853-2019	Goswein, Verena/0000-0002-9206-7450; habert, Guillaume/0000-0003-3533-7896			Embodied GHGs in a Fast Growing City: Looking at the Evolution of a Dwelling Stock using Structural Element Breakdown and Policy Scenarios								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY				22	6			1339	1351		10.1111/jiec.12700				DEC 2018	2018	Africa is currently experiencing rapid population growth and accelerated urbanization. This demographic shift will require a large amount of new construction material resulting in substantial environmental impact. For many cities on the continent, data gaps make specific quantification and robust prediction of this impact highly difficult. This article presents a method to assess the stock dynamics and embodied emissions of a rapidly growing urban built environment using a bottom-up, typological approach. This approach allows for the identification of appropriate engineering solutions for decarbonization by localizing embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the different constructive elements with a revisited Sankey diagram. Different alternatives regarding housing type and construction techniques are compared. The city of Johannesburg is used as a case study to illustrate the relation between building types, technologies, and embodied GHG of its residential building stock. This new visualization uncovers the most material- and GHG-intense dwelling types and building elements. The adapted Sankey represents the building stock and its drivers in a simple way, allowing clear understanding of the consequences of potential alternatives. The business-as-usual scenario indicates 100.5 megatons carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-eq) for new construction between 2011 and 2040. The results of the dynamic model over time show that only a combination of a densified building stock with multistory buildings and the use of alternative construction materials and techniques show real potential to decelerate GHG emissions (33.0 Mt CO2-eq until 2040) while aiming to provide adequate and sustainable housing for all.									3	0	0	1	0	3	2	21	1088-1980	1530-9290		WOS:000447649500006		J	Leon, Ai; Ishihara, Keiichi N.

These systems have certain additional functions, namely, sunlight sharing, land sharing and power generation, as compared to the conventional agricultural production systems. These new functions are not adequately performed by traditionally used functional units (FUs), such as the mass- or the area-based FU, in agricultural life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, this study proposed new FUs for agrivoltaic systems, namely the modified area-based FU and the monetary-based FU. The modified area-based FU was derived by adding area covered by PV modules to the cultivated area addressing the function of land sharing. The monetary-based FU was derived by adding the prices of crops and electricity addressing the function of the system as a producer of differently valued market goods. The traditional area-based FU is based on the function of solar sharing because crop cultivation and power generation share the same sunlight falling on the same land. These new and traditional FUs were applied to a tomato greenhouse, with and without organic photovoltaics, as a case study of Japan. A combination of traditional and new FUs helps to maintain focus on crop production as the primary function of agricultural land and to better understand the environmental impacts of agrivoltaic systems. Finally, as the sharing of sunlight and land happen simultaneously, a method that addresses both these functions while reporting LCA results was considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0	8	22	0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000446147000051	30153622	J	Choi, Sungho								A Corporate Understanding of Biblical Salvation and Its Application to Climate Change Mitigation Measures								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC THEOLOGY				12	3-4			379	400		10.1163/15697320-12341548				NOV 2018	2018	This article deals with a theological approach to the issue of climate change and examines some of the misconceptions found within Christianity with regards the environment. These distortions of understanding can be traced back to the way in which salvation is articulated and perceived. In the circumstances it becomes a pressing public task to consider the key biblical conceptions of salvation. Of critical significance is how the salvific tradition is understood to be corporate rather than individualistic. That is so right from the beginning of Israel's redemptive history and carries through the biblical material to include God's redemptive work in Christ which is itself extended through to the rest of creation. The current mitigation measures (and their limitations) with regards to climate change are critically evaluated alongside these salvific claims.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1872-5171	1569-7320		WOS:000456118700005		J	Leroux, Justin; Spiro, Daniel					Spiro, Daniel/0000-0002-6819-832X			Leading the unwilling: Unilateral strategies to prevent arctic oil exploration								RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS				54				125	149		10.1016/j.reseneeco.2018.08.002				NOV 2018	2018	Arctic oil extraction is inconsistent with the 2 degrees C target. We study unilateral strategies by climate-concerned Arctic countries to deter extraction by others. Contradicting common theoretical assumptions about climate-change mitigation, our setting is one where countries may fundamentally disagree about whether mitigation by others is beneficial. This is because Arctic oil extraction requires specific R&D, hence entry by one country expands the extraction-technology market, decreasing costs for others. This means that, on the one hand, countries that extract Arctic oil gain if others do so as well. On the other hand, as countries may disagree about how harmful climate change is, they may disagree whether an equilibrium where all enter is better or worse than an equilibrium where all stay out. Less environmentally-concerned countries (preferring maximum entry) have a first-mover advantage but, because they rely on entry by others, entry in equilibrium is determined by the preferences of those who are moderately concerned about the environment. Furthermore, using a pooling strategy, an environmentally-concerned country can deter entry by credibly "pretending" to be environmentally adamant, and thus be expected to not follow. A rough calibration suggests a country like Norway, or prospects of a green future U.S. administration, could be pivotal in determining whether the Arctic will be explored. (C) 2018 The Authors.

It is therefore necessary to characterise the Swiss building stock and in particular the residential sector at an appropriate degree of detail, distinguishing between various types of buildings (archetypes) and building elements in order to identify the untapped potential for energy retrofit. In this paper, the current thermal performance and retrofit state of the Swiss residential building stock is examined based on approximately 10,400 Cantonal Building Energy Certificates issued for individual buildings across the country. The statistical analysis of the certificates allows to estimate a thermal performance level of archetype buildings and their respective building elements as well as of the heating systems. For this purpose, we develop a method allowing to obtain typical U-Values for original and retrofitted buildings from the total U-Value distributions. Our results indicate that approximately 75% of all building elements do not yet reach the thermal performance of buildings constructed in the last 15 years. In order to reach current low-energy building standards (MINERGIE P), the U-Values of building elements constructed prior to 1990 would have to be reduced by a factor of three to more than six, from 0.5-1 W/(m(2)K) to 0.15 W/(m(2)K); windows would require an improvement by at least a factor of two, from 2.5-2 to 0.9W/(m(2)K). With regard to heat supply, 50% of the surface area is still heated by inefficient and CO2-intensive oil-fired boilers. The results of this study hence confirm the high potential for thermal retrofit in the Swiss residential building stock. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It applies this approach to party manifestos in six countries, comparing the preferences of parties in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom over the past two decades. It probes the data for evidence of validity through content validation and convergent/discriminant validation and engages with the debate on position-taking in environmental policy by developing a positional measure that incorporates 'pro' and 'anti' climate policy preferences. The analysis provides evidence for the validity of the new measures, shows that they are distinct from comparable measures of environmental policy preferences and argues that they are more comprehensive than existing climate policy measures. The new measures strengthen the basis for answering questions that are central to climate politics and to party politics. The approach developed here has important implications for the study of new, complex or cross-cutting policy issues and issues that include both valence and positional aspects.									5	0	1	0	0	5	3	12	1354-0688	1460-3683		WOS:000448267000011	30443155	J	Balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard; Bin Marsono, Abdul Kadir; Khaleghi, Seyed Jalal				balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard/T-2452-2017	balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard/0000-0002-7823-0477			Sustainability choice of different hybrid timber structure for low medium cost single-story residential building: Environmental, economic and social assessment								JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING				20				235	247		10.1016/j.jobe.2018.07.006				NOV 2018	2018	The impact of different hybrid timber building construction on three different categories namely: environment, economic and social is analyzed in this research.

The life cycle aspect of current research is evaluated for global warming potential (GWP), human-toxicity potential (HTP), eutrophication (EP), fossil depletion (FDP), acidification (AP), life cycle cost (LCC) and social life cycle assessment (SLCA). The result revealed the different emissions between various structural schemes in all stages. Decision making process was oriented to sustainability as the hybrid steel stud & timber (T2) generally performed better than timber structure with concrete, LVL or GLT with steel. Particularly, T2 had the lowest GWP (3.31E+3 kg-CO2-eq) and LCC (212,750 MYR) which was the lowest in comparison with other hybrid timber structures. Also the result of job creation revealed that timber sector will provide higher wage not only for existing employees but for timber sector regarding creating higher job possibility. The sensitivity analysis was accomplished on electricity usage and assumed instead of full fossil fuel mix electricity applied for acquiring construction material on mill. The result shows almost 15-30% less GWP emission for all building structure.									5	0	0	1	0	5	5	22	2352-7102			WOS:000446539400024		J	Berger, Sebastian; Bartsch, Christian; Schmidt, Christina; Christandl, Fabian; Wyss, Annika M.

One of the culturally most robust human routines is the heavy reliance of the Western societies on conventional meat sources such as beef, pork, and poultry, which were recently accused of causing particularly high climate costs. In this light, the UN (FAO) has suggested the increasing use of insects as an alternative source of animal protein intended for human diets. Yet, insects have not reached the mainstream of Western cuisine. Currently, a frequent promotion strategy of insects is to highlight the Utilitarian benefits associated with their consumption (e.g., with respect to the environment or one's health). The present research addresses the efficacy of such claims in a consumer research study involving 180 participants recruited from the general population in Germany. Arguing based on social-cognitive research in the area of moral and environmental psychology, we hypothesized and found that a focus on beneficial, but temporally distant motives (e.g., health)-counterintuitively-decreases consumption in comparison to immediate, hedonic advertisements (e.g., tasty). Furthermore, our study provides process evidence suggesting pretrial expectations induced by a particular claim mediate the relationship between claims and consumption. Thus, the present research not only refutes a state-of-the-art approach in the promotion of insects as food, but also provides an alternative approach and process evidence by integrating psychological factors.									4	0	0	1	0	4	1	6	2296-861X			WOS:000447401400001	30333980	J	Liu, Hongbo; Xiong, Yabo; Guan, Yonglian; Xu, Suyun								Decarbonization and denitrification characteristics of a coupling ABR-MFC-MEC process treating black water								DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT				129				43	52		10.5004/dwt.2018.22797				OCT 2018	2018	Untreated black water is harmful to the environment due to its contents of large amounts of organic compounds, ammonia (NH4+-N) and pathogenic bacterium. The combined ABR-MFC-MEC (anaerobic baffle reactor-microbial fuel cell-microbial electrolysis cell) process was developed in this study to treat black water without external input of energy or oxygen. The degradation features of carbonaceous matter and nitrogen pollutants in black water were investigated using the combined ABRMFC-MEC process in this study. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4+-N removal rates of the study process were over 92% and 50%, respectively, when feeding an influent (black water) with COD concentration of 1,500 +/- 100 mg L-1 and NH4+-N concentration of 60 +/- 5 mg L-1, while maintaining the whole process hydraulic retention time as 24 h. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria were found to be the dominant electrogenesis flora supporting decarbonization and denitrification in the combined ABR-MFC-MEC process.									1	0	0	1	0	1	8	23	1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000448674000005		J	Jeuland, Marc; Soo, Jie-Sheng Tan; Shindell, Drew								The need for policies to reduce the costs of cleaner cooking in low income settings: Implications from systematic analysis of costs and benefits								ENERGY POLICY				121				275	285		10.1016/j.enpol.2018.06.031				OCT 2018	2018	Inefficient household cooking in less-developed countries harms health and productivity, the environment, and the global climate. Interventions to encourage adoption of cleaner and more fuel-efficient stoves are being implemented widely to reduce these burdens, but sustained use has proven elusive. This study develops a data-driven simulation approach to investigate the potential costs and benefits of cleaner stoves, informed by recent empirical studies. The results suggest that the private case for adoption of technologies other than charcoal ICS is often unclear; that is, households' private benefits do not usually outweigh the costs of these improvements. Overall social benefits, in contrast, are typically positive and large for nearly all such improved technologies. We investigate how economic benefits vary with intensity of use, and find that higher use does not unambiguously translate into greater private benefits. Analyzing the effects of different subsidies, we further find that fuel subsidies for purchased fuels could substantially improve private net benefits, but that even these may be insufficient to make cleaner cooking attractive to many households; stove subsidies meanwhile tend to modestly improve private outcomes. To capture the social benefits of cleaner cooking, new and effective incentives may be needed to support household use of efficient stoves.									2	0	0	0	0	2	2	8	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000445983800028		J	Ma, Li; Wang, Liang; Wu, Kuo-Jui; Tseng, Ming-Lang				Wu, Kuo-Jui/N-1926-2019	Wu, Kuo-Jui/0000-0002-6246-8245			Assessing co-benefit barriers among stakeholders in Chinese construction industry								RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING				137				101	112		10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.05.029				OCT 2018	2018	The construction industry in China is trying very hard to achieve sustainable development. Meanwhile, it is important to balance the pursuit of stakeholders and addresses the obstacles encountered by these stakeholders. There are few studies that have comprehensively discussed how to combine co-benefits with stakeholder theory to tackle conflicts of interests and achieve co-benefits in Chinese construction industry. This study adopts grey theory to collect and integrate professional suggestions from different experts into indexes that can be compared and analyzed. Then, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to rank the stakeholders as well as criteria for selecting the optimum alternative, and uses the crawler technology to gain each criterion's weight for each stakeholder. Our research results show that the stakeholders of suppliers, firms, and the sustainable community are deemed to have priority to achieve co-benefits. The main criteria to consider in achieving co-benefits are transferring technology developments, respecting cultural habitats and traditions, and environment pollution controls. The main contributions are as follows: (1) theoretically, the basis for stakeholders to estimate the co-benefits was obtained (2) the corresponding mixed method to conduct the assessment was developed in Chinse construction industry.									2	0	0	2	0	2	4	38	0921-3449	1879-0658		WOS:000441687900008		J	Bak, Dan-Bi; Bak, Jae-Seok; Kim, Sung-Yul								Strategies for Implementing Public Service Electric Bus Lines by Charging Type in Daegu Metropolitan City, South Korea								SUSTAINABILITY				10	10					3386	10.3390/su10103386				OCT 2018	2018	The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles in the public sector is essential for achieving emission reduction targets for transportation. In particular, the replacement of buses with internal combustion engines, which travel long distances and produce massive greenhouse gas emissions, by their electric counterparts can drastically reduce emissions. A variety of electric buses with different power supply systems are currently available, and their performance, charging type, battery capacity, and operating environment are related parameters that must be addressed for their successful and massive adoption. For instance, the appropriate charging type of electric buses depends on conditions, such as the operating environment. In this study, we determined the optimum capacity of electric bus batteries by considering the electric bus range, battery depth of discharge, and deterioration cost while using ADVISOR, which is a MATLAB-based electric vehicle simulator. In addition, we assessed the energy consumed and charging time according to the operating environments of electric buses. Finally, an economic efficiency analysis allowed for determining the appropriated charging type for electric buses. By integrating these data and analyses, we propose a comprehensive plan for selecting the most appropriate charging type according to the operating environment of these electric vehicles. We expect that the proposed plan will contribute to the adoption of electric buses and achieve the greenhouse gas reduction targets set by South Korea.									4	0	0	0	0	4	1	4	2071-1050			WOS:000448559400028		J	Sbardella, Angelica; Perruchas, Francois; Napolitano, Lorenzo; Barbieri, Nicolo; Consoli, Davide				Consoli, Davide/Q-7183-2019; Perruchas, Francois/K-7844-2014	Consoli, Davide/0000-0002-7829-2838; Perruchas, Francois/0000-0003-3821-0014; Barbieri, Nicolo/0000-0002-8332-9826; Napolitano, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7829-7340			Green Technology Fitness								ENTROPY				20	10					776	10.3390/e20100776				OCT 2018	2018	The present study provides an analysis of empirical regularities in the development of green technology. We use patent data to examine inventions that can be traced to the environment-related catalogue (ENV-Tech) covering technologies in environmental management, water-related adaptation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, we employ the Economic Fitness-Complexity (EFC) approach to assess their development and geographical distribution across countries between 1970 and 2010. This allows us to identify three typologies of countries: leaders, laggards and catch-up. While, as expected, there is a direct relationship between GDP per capita and invention capacity, we also document the remarkable growth of East Asia countries that started from the periphery and rapidly established themselves as key actors. This geographical pattern coincides with higher integration across domains so that, while the relative development of individual areas may have peaked, there is now demand for greater interoperability across green technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	6	1099-4300			WOS:000448545700057		J	Wang, Haibin; Zhou, Peilin				Wang, Haibin/E-8601-2016	Wang, Haibin/0000-0002-3520-6856			Systematic evaluation approach for carbon reduction method assessment - A life cycle assessment case study on carbon solidification method								OCEAN ENGINEERING				165				480	487		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.07.050				OCT 1 2018	2018	MEPC 70 foresees a greenhouse gas reduction strategy will be in force in 2018. Researchers are striving to investigate different GHG reduction technologies to determine their feasibility in the aspect of both environment and economy. However, the evaluations are not specific or comprehensive so this paper presents a systematic evaluation approach to guide policy makers to evaluate the performances and to help ship owners to select suitable reduction technologies. One carbon reduction method proposed by authors was proved to be cost effective and this paper applies life cycle analysis focusing on all stages of ship life to investigate, determine and compare the feasibility of this methods in the aspect of environmental and cost impact which are two significant standard for the assessment. The results indicate the application of reduction method leads to a lower global warming potential when the carbon reduction target is increased. Oppositely, the economic benefits increased while complying with strict regulation. This paper also indicates to achieve carbon reduction target set up by regulation, a marginal target will be necessary. Evaluation of carbon reduction method using life cycle assessment is also recommended to policy makers and ship owners to provide them comparable results and reasonable decision makings.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0029-8018			WOS:000446287400037		J	Morita, Kanako; Matsumoto, Ken'ichi								REDD+Financing to Enhance Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation and Biodiversity Co-benefits: Lessons from the Global Environment Facility (vol 40, pg 118, 2018)								AGRIVITA				40	3			567	568		10.17503/agrivita				OCT 2018	2018										0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0126-0537			WOS:000445934600020		J	Xie, Yang; Dai, Hancheng; Xu, Xinghan; Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Yi, Kan; Masui, Toshihiko; Kurata, Gakuji				Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; Dai, Hancheng/Y-8275-2019; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015	Dai, Hancheng/0000-0003-4251-4707; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; yi, kan/0000-0002-4470-9754			Co-benefits of climate mitigation on air quality and human health in Asian countries								ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL				119				309	318		10.1016/j.envint.2018.07.008				OCT 2018	2018	Climate change mitigation involves reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which is expensive, particularly under stringent mitigation targets. The co-benefits of reducing air pollutants and improving human health are often ignored, but can play significant roles in decision-making. In this study, we quantified the co-benefits of climate change mitigation on ambient air quality and human health in both physical and monetary terms with a particular focus on Asia, where air quality will likely be degraded in the next few decades if mitigation measures are not undertaken. We used an integrated assessment framework that incorporated economic, air chemistry transport, and health assessment models. Air pollution reduction through climate change mitigation under the 2 degrees C goal could reduce premature deaths in Asia by 0.79 million (95% confidence interval: 0.75-1.8 million) by 2050. This co-benefit is equivalent to a life value savings of approximately 2.8 trillion United States dollars (USD) (6% of the gross domestic product [GDP]), which is decidedly more than the climate mitigation cost (840 billion USD, 2% of GDP). At the national level, India has the highest potential net benefit of 1.4 trillion USD, followed by China (330 billion USD) and Japan (68 billion USD). Furthermore, in most Asian countries, per capita GDP gain and life value savings would increase with per capita GDP increasing. We robustly confirmed this qualitative conclusion under several socioeconomic and exposureresponse function assumptions.									7	0	0	1	0	7	15	52	0160-4120	1873-6750		WOS:000444918100034	29990951	J	Vogler-Finck, P.

However, in a pre-transition system, the carbon intensity of power exhibits strong variations over time, which calls for load shifting to times when its impact is lower. In this work, the case of heating in single-family houses is studied, using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimise multi-zone operation. Low inertia heating is used, and simulations are made upon three different insulation level using historical grid and climate data from Denmark. The results show that energy and CO2 optimisation are relevant objectives for predictive control for lowering the carbon footprint of heating, while SPOT price optimisation is comparatively undesirable. However, benefits of energy optimisation were questioned, as a well-tuned PID control might have had similar performance. Nevertheless, gains from CO2 optimisation in recent houses highlight the importance of considering the average carbon intensity of energy used, in addition to the amount of energy itself, when aiming to reduce the carbon footprint.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	9	2210-6707	2210-6715		WOS:000443741600047		J	Sohma, Akio; Shibuki, Hisashi; Nakajima, Fumiyuki; Kubo, Atsushi; Kuwae, Tomohiro								Modeling a coastal ecosystem to estimate climate change mitigation and a model demonstration in Tokyo Bay								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				384				261	289		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.04.019				SEP 24 2018	2018	An ecosystem model called the "EMAGIN-B.C. ver 1.0 (Ecosystem Model for Aquatic Geologic Integrated Network for Blue Carbon)", describing the Carbon-Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Oxygen-Calcium cycle was developed to estimate/predict carbon capture and storage in estuaries. EMAGIN-B.C. analyzes (1) carbon burial, wherein carbon is captured biologically in the pelagic and benthic ecosystems and stored in deeper sediments, (2) CO2 uptake at the ocean surface while considering the carbonate chemistry with total alkalinity and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) production/consumption due to biochemical processes, (3) DIC capture associated with grazing at the trophic level among phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic fauna, (4) the effects of hypoxia on benthic fauna and bacteria by precise modeling of the biochemical oxygen production/consumption and the resultant hypoxia, and (5) the carbon transport by integration with the hydrodynamic model. EMAGIN-B.C. was applied to Tokyo Bay, a eutrophic, shallow coastal area, and reproduced the observations well. From the model outputs, it can be observed that Tokyo Bay shows functions of climate change mitigation. In the one-year carbon budget, Tokyo Bay captured 16.6% of the DIC from the atmosphere and river as organic matter by biological processes, and 3.9% of the total carbon flowing from the atmosphere and river was stored in the deeper sediment layer.									2	0	0	0	0	2	6	12	0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000447581600026		J	Klapwijk, M.

However, it has proven difficult to harness their full potential for climate change mitigation. Managed forests are often referred to as socio-ecological systems as the human dimension is an integral part of the system. When attempting to change systems that are influenced by factors such as collective knowledge, social organization, understanding of the situation and values represented in society, initial intentions often shift due to the complexity of political, social and scientific interactions. Currently, the scientific literature is dispersed over the different factors related to the socio-ecological system. To examine the level of dispersion and to obtain a holistic view, we review climate change mitigation in the context of Swedish forest research. We introduce a heuristic framework to understand decision-making connected to climate change mitigation. We apply our framework to two themes which span different dimensions in the socio-ecological system: carbon accounting and bioenergy. A key finding in the literature was the perception that current uncertainties regarding the reliability of different methods of carbon accounting inhibits international agreement on the use of forests for climate change mitigation. This feeds into a strategic obstacle affecting the willingness of individual countries to implement forest related carbon emission reduction policies. Decisions on the utilization of forests for bioenergy are impeded by a lack of knowledge regarding the resultant biophysical and social consequences. This interacts negatively with the development of institutional incentives regarding the production of bioenergy using forest products. Normative disagreement about acceptable forest use further affects these scientific discussions and therefore is an over-arching influence on decision-making. With our framework, we capture this complexity and make obstacles to decision-making more transparent to enable their more effective resolution. We have identified the main research areas concerned with the use of managed forest in climate change mitigation and the obstacles that are connected to decision making.									1	0	0	1	0	1	2	4	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000449444900022		J	Riti, Joshua Sunday; Song, Deyong; Shu, Yang; Kamah, Miriam; Atabani, Agya Adi				Riti, Joshua S./Q-7631-2019; Adi, Agya/R-6382-2019				Does renewable energy ensure environmental quality in favour of economic growth?

Economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions in China have been increasing together over the past several years. Exploring the dynamic relationship among these variables has a lot of policy implications related to environment-growth-energy linkage. This paper explores the interrelationship among CO2 emissions, economic growth, disaggregated energy (fossil fuel and renewable) consumption and population. The broad objective of the paper is to examine the potential role of renewable energy consumption to ensure environmental quality in favour of growth. Data spanned from 1971 to 2013 sourced from World Bank data base. The results from auto regression distributed lag suggests that fossil fuel energy consumption increases CO2 emissions, both in the short and the long run, but renewable energy consumption reduces CO2 emissions in the long run. Although economic growth and population increase CO2 emissions in the short run, their impacts on CO2 emissions in the long run diminish, validating the environmental carbon Kuznets curve hypothesis in China. Short run vector error correction mechanism Granger causality results reveal unidirectional causality from both fossil fuel and renewable energy consumption to CO2 emissions revealing growth hypothesis. Bidirectional causality exists between both energies and economic growth confirming the role of energy on economic expansion vis-A-vis the role of income on energy consumption. The findings have important policy implications for harmonizing economic growth vis-A-vis environmental quality and thus climate change mitigation with a higher proportion of energy from renewables.									3	0	0	2	0	3	8	24	0033-5177	1573-7845		WOS:000440115300002		J	Marchi, Enrico; Chung, Woodam; Visser, Rien; Abbas, Dalia; Nordfjell, Tomas; Mederski, Piotr S.; McEwan, Andrew; Brink, Michal; Laschi, Andrea				Marchi, Enrico/O-9318-2019; Marchi, Enrico/N-1110-2019; Mederski, Piotr S./K-3196-2016; Marchi, Enrico/F-9943-2011; Chung, Woodam/A-5832-2018	Marchi, Enrico/0000-0001-6485-7044; Mederski, Piotr S./0000-0003-3060-4422; Marchi, Enrico/0000-0001-6485-7044; Chung, Woodam/0000-0001-9203-7166; Laschi, Andrea/0000-0003-3868-3583			Sustainable Forest Operations (SFO): A new paradigm in a changing world and climate								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				634				1385	1397		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.084				SEP 1 2018	2018	The effective implementation of sustainable forest management depends largely on carrying out forest operations in a sustainable manner. Climate change, as well as the increasing demand for forest products, requires a re-thinking of forest operations in terms of sustainability. In this context, it is important to understand the major driving factors for the future development of forest operations that promote economic, environmental and social well-being. The main objective of this paper is to identify important issues concerning forest operations and to propose a new paradigm towards sustainability in a changing climate, work and environmental conditions. Previously developed concepts of forest operations are reviewed, and a newly developed concept Sustainable Forest Operations (SFO), is presented. Five key performance areas to ensure the sustainability of forest operations include: (i) environment; (ii) ergonomics; (iii) economics; (iv) quality optimization of products and production; and (v) people and society. Practical field examples are presented to demonstrate how these five interconnected principles are relevant to achieving sustainability, namely profit and wood quality maximization, ecological benefits, climate change mitigation, carbon sequestration, and forest workers' health and safety. The new concept of SFO provides integrated perspectives and approaches to effectively address ongoing and foreseeable challenges the global forest communities face, while balancing forest operations performance across economic, environmental and social sustainability. In this new concept, we emphasize the role of wood as a renewable and environmentally friendly material, and forest workers' safety and utilization efficiency and waste management as additional key elements of sustainability.

Insulation or Smart Temperature Control for Domestic Heating: A Combined Analysis of the Costs, the Eco-Costs, the Customer Perceived Value, and the Rebound Effect of Energy Saving								SUSTAINABILITY				10	9					3231	10.3390/su10093231				SEP 2018	2018	Calculating the environmental benefits of energy saving systems in dwellings in a life cycle assessment (LCA) has two major issues, namely: how to deal with the customer behaviour and how to deal with rebound effects. Both issues are important for sustainable strategies. From a user-centred design perspective, two fundamentally different strategies are observed, namely: a passive' end-user, who invests in insulating the building and maintaining their preferred behaviour routines, versus an active' end-user; who must change his or her behaviour in order to save energy. A combined analysis of cost, (market) value, and eco-burden is used to compare and evaluate the two strategies; by applying the methods of eco-costs/value ratio (EVR) and eco-efficient value creation. Simulation software is applied to calculate the results for the active end-user approach (by means of home energy management systems [HEMS]). The energy savings for a passive user approach (applying thermal insulation) are calculated with straightforward heat loss calculations. The rebound effect of energy savings is taken into consideration. From the environmental point of view, the optimal insulation thickness is calculated, by comparing the energy savings with the environmental burden of the insulation materials. This analysis shows that HEMS are effective for poorly insulated houses, but not for well insulated houses. Governmental policies that focus only on insulation, however, lack the urgency of greenhouse gas reduction; the HEMS for existing houses is an indispensable tool for a fast transition to less domestic energy consumption.									1	0	0	0	0	1	3	11	2071-1050			WOS:000446770200274		J	Mansuy, Nicolas; Barrette, Julie; Laganiere, Jerome; Mabee, Warren; Pare, David; Gautam, Shuva; Thiffault, Evelyne; Ghafghazi, Saeed					Thiffault, Evelyne/0000-0001-9586-3834; LAGANIERE, JEROME/0000-0003-2649-9113			Salvage harvesting for bioenergy in Canada: From sustainable and integrated supply chain to climate change mitigation								WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT				7	5					e298	10.1002/wene.298				SEP-OCT 2018	2018	Driven by the policy imperatives of mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving energy security, an increasing proportion of global energy demand is being met by nonfossil energy sources. The socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to supply wood-based bioenergy, by addressing the following multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2) How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an integrated supply chain and cost-effective mobilization of the biomass? (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could theoretically provide about 100 x 10(6) oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains, because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is needed to develop a cost-efficient bioenergy sector.This article is categorized under:Bioenergy > Climate and Environment									1	0	0	0	0	1	8	23	2041-8396	2041-840X		WOS:000441899300001		J	Kung, Chih-Chun; McCarl, Bruce A.

In this context, sustainable energy development involves augmenting our energy supplies and managing demands in a fashion that societal energy needs are met with a minimal effect on greenhouse gas emissions and a nominal resultant contribution to future climate change. In this Special Issue, research papers focus on the role of sustainable energy development (while addressing important dimensions of sustainability), which mandates an inter-disciplinary perspective in all articles. We collected 11 such papers that have analyzed a broad array of topics related to bioenergy, wind power, industrial innovation, and climate change mitigation. These papers show the varied application of renewable energy and climate change energy responses, while providing meaningful decision-making information and policy implications.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	3	2071-1050			WOS:000446770200312		J	Kurze, Kristina; Lenschow, Andrea								Horizontal policy coherence starts with problem definition: Unpacking the EU integrated energy-climate approach								ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE				28	5	SI		329	338		10.1002/eet.1819				SEP-OCT 2018	2018	The existing policy coherence literature usually takes problem definition for granted. Building on the case of the Energy Policy for Europe we argue that a focus on shifting problem definitions adds depth to the analysis of policy coherence as it allows us to problematize the standard on which the judgment of coherence is based. We further argue that problem definition is instrumental in enabling certain horizontal policy options. Empirically, the European Union's (EU's) support of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies illustrates that policy coherence between EU energy and environmental policies is increasingly conceptualized as an integrated approach headed for climate change mitigation and a low-carbon economy. We show that by shifting the focus of policy integration and coherence from environment to climate policy, CCS moved from the margins to the center of available policy options. Arguably, this comes at the expense of coherence if viewed from a broader sustainable development perspective.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	7	1756-932X	1756-9338		WOS:000447126200002		J	Mazarrasa, Ines; Sarnper-Villarreal, Jimena; Serrano, Oscar; Lavery, Paul S.; Lovelock, Catherine E.; Marba, Nuria; Duarte, Carlos M.; Cortes, Jorge				Lovelock, Catherine/G-7370-2012; Marba, Nuria/H-8136-2015; Mazarrasa, Ines/A-8420-2017; Duarte, Carlos M./A-7670-2013	Lovelock, Catherine/0000-0002-2219-6855; Marba, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; Mazarrasa, Ines/0000-0002-5476-9953; Duarte, Carlos M./0000-0002-1213-1361			Habitat characteristics provide insights of carbon storage in seagrass meadows								MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN				134		SI		106	117		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.01.059				SEP 2018	2018	Seagrass meadows provide multiple ecosystem services, yet they are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Because of their role as carbon sinks, protection and restoration of seagrass meadows contribute to climate change mitigation. Blue Carbon strategies aim to enhance CO2 sequestration and avoid greenhouse gasses emissions through the management of coastal vegetated ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. The implementation of Blue Carbon strategies requires a good understanding of the habitat characteristics that influence C-org sequestration. Here, we review the existing knowledge on Blue Carbon research in seagrass meadows to identify the key habitat characteristics that influence C-org sequestration in seagrass meadows, those factors that threaten this function and those with unclear effects. We demonstrate that not all seagrass habitats have the same potential, identify research priorities and describe the implications of the results found for the implementation and development of efficient Blue Carbon strategies based on seagrass meadows.									9	0	0	7	0	9	4	26	0025-326X	1879-3363		WOS:000447116800013	29459167	J	Dai, Hancheng; Xie, Yang; Zhang, Haibin; Yu, Zhongjue; Wang, Wentao				Dai, Hancheng/Y-8275-2019	Dai, Hancheng/0000-0003-4251-4707			Effects of the US withdrawal from Paris Agreement on the carbon emission space and cost of China and India								FRONTIERS IN ENERGY				12	3	SI		362	375		10.1007/s11708-018-0574-y				SEP 2018	2018	Climate mitigation has become a global issue and most countries have promised their greenhouse gas reduction target. However, after Trump took office as president of the United States (US), the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement. As the biggest economy, this would have impacts on the emission space of other countries. This paper, by using the integrated model of energy, environment and economy/computable general equilibrium (IMED/CGE) model, assesses the impacts of the US withdrawal from Paris Agreement on China, India in terms of carbon emission space and mitigation cost under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and 2 degrees C scenarios due to changed emission pathway of the US. The results show that, under the condition of constant global cumulative carbon emissions and fixed burden sharing scheme among the countries, the failure of the US to honor its NDC commitment will increase its carbon emission space and decrease its mitigation cost. However, the carbon emission space of other regions, including China and India, will be reduced and their mitigation costs will be raised. In 2030, under the 2 degrees C target, the carbon price will increase by US$14.3 to US$45.3/t in China and by US $10.7 to US$33.9/t in India. In addition, China and India will incur additional GDP loss. Under the 2 degrees C target, the GDP loss of China would increase by US$23.3 to US$72.6 billion (equivalent to US$17.4 to US$54.2/capita), and that of India would rise by US$14.2 to US$43.1 billion (equivalent to US$9.3 to US$28.2/capita).									1	0	0	0	0	1	4	61	2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000444459300005		J	Simshauser, Paul				Simshauser, Paul/H-1244-2015	Simshauser, Paul/0000-0003-1857-550X			Garbage can theory and Australia's National Electricity Market: Decarbonisation in a hostile policy environment								ENERGY POLICY				120				697	713		10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.068				SEP 2018	2018	After two decades of consistent economic and technical performance, conditions in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) deteriorated sharply in 2016/17. Prices more than doubled on the east coast, tripled in South Australia (SA), and the SA regional grid collapsed. Nothing spectacular occurred with final demand this was a supply-side energy crisis driven by the exit of 18% of Australia's coal-fired generation fleet and the inadequate entry of new plant. Australia's NEM encountered an uncoordinated exit-driven episode of the Resource Adequacy problem. In the USA where 18% of coal plant has also exited, Resource Adequacy and low cost energy has been maintained by the entry of an enormous fleet of wind, solar and gas-fired generators. In Australia, an equivalent response did not occur; decades of climate change policy discontinuity meant the speed of coal plant exit was unpredictable, entry of renewables delayed through stop-start policy, and gas-fired plant was subject to critical hold-up due to excess LNG plant investment. Resolution requires a united and stable climate change policy architecture that works with, not against, the NEM's world-class institutional design, and greater transparency around planned plant exit.									5	0	0	0	0	4	6	13	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000440123300065		J	Goddard, George; Farrelly, Megan A.

Transition management has emerged as a promising approach to proactively manage and accelerate transitions in sectors like energy and water and has the potential to do so in manner that would help secure energy justice. However, the approach has been criticised for ignoring the political dynamics of transitions, risking procedural and recognition injustice for traditional energy production regions while increasing opposition to a transition. This paper uses a qualitative case study approach to understand how a transition to renewable energy generation could be achieved in a way that secures energy justice for traditional energy production regions like those of Gladstone in the Australian state of Queensland. The paper augments the transition management approach with the "just transitions" concept, which has emerged from labour movements as a means to mitigate negative impacts on workers and communities in traditional energy production regions, to create a "Just Transition Management" framework that is applied as a diagnostic tool to the case study. While results suggest a transition is imminent within Queensland, a lack of: consistent, supportive federal policy; long-term visions, and a clear process leaves it at risk of being captured by the powerful incumbent resources sector utilising an "environment vs. jobs" narrative. Yet, the results also suggest that adopting a just transition management approach has the potential to successfully resist the influence of the resources sector, by providing cheap, secure renewable energy and supporting affected workers into roles in the renewable energy sector using a reflexive, representative network governance approach. Data analysis reveals how the application of just transition principles has already engaged communities and unions that were previously sceptical of renewable energy. Overall, this study suggests that the just transition management framework assists in identifying the political barriers to transitions and energy justice more broadly, while also providing a management approach which creates powerful niche actor-networks to counter the narratives and influence of the incumbent resource sector. Thus it could support successful transitions that achieve the distributional, recognition and procedural justice needed for energy justice globally.									4	0	0	0	0	4	5	23	0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000438181000010		J	Hamin, Elisabeth M.; Abunnasr, Yaser; Dilthey, Max Roman; Judge, Pamela K.; Kenney, Melissa A.; Kirshen, Paul; Sheahan, Thomas C.; DeGroot, Don J.; Ryan, Robert L.; McAdoo, Brain G.; Nurse, Leonard; Buxton, Jane A.; Sutton-Grier, Ariana E.; Albright, Elizabeth A.; Marin, Marielos Arlen; Fricke, Rebecca				; Kenney, Melissa/H-6426-2014	Sutton-Grier, Ariana/0000-0002-1242-7728; Kenney, Melissa/0000-0002-2121-8135; Judge, Pamela/0000-0002-8443-7829			Pathways to Coastal Resiliency: The Adaptive Gradients Framework								SUSTAINABILITY				10	8					2629	10.3390/su10082629				AUG 2018	2018	Current and future climate-related coastal impacts such as catastrophic and repetitive flooding, hurricane intensity, and sea level rise necessitate a new approach to developing and managing coastal infrastructure. Traditional "hard" or "grey" engineering solutions are proving both expensive and inflexible in the face of a rapidly changing coastal environment. Hybrid solutions that incorporate natural, nature-based, structural, and non-structural features may better achieve a broad set of goals such as ecological enhancement, long-term adaptation, and social benefits, but broad consideration and uptake of these approaches has been slow. One barrier to the widespread implementation of hybrid solutions is the lack of a relatively quick but holistic evaluation framework that places these broader environmental and societal goals on equal footing with the more traditional goal of exposure reduction. To respond to this need, the Adaptive Gradients Framework was developed and pilot-tested as a qualitative, flexible, and collaborative process guide for organizations to understand, evaluate, and potentially select more diverse kinds of infrastructural responses. These responses would ideally include natural, nature-based, and regulatory/cultural approaches, as well as hybrid designs combining multiple approaches. It enables rapid expert review of project designs based on eight metrics called "gradients", which include exposure reduction, cost efficiency, institutional capacity, ecological enhancement, adaptation over time, greenhouse gas reduction, participatory process, and social benefits. The framework was conceptualized and developed in three phases: relevant factors and barriers were collected from practitioners and experts by survey; these factors were ranked by importance and used to develop the initial framework; several case studies were iteratively evaluated using this technique; and the framework was finalized for implementation. The article presents the framework and a pilot test of its application, along with resources that would enable wider application of the framework by practitioners and theorists.									1	0	0	0	0	1	2	12		2071-1050		WOS:000446767700045		J	Matheus, Fabricio Scarpeta								The role of forests and protected areas in climate change mitigation: a review and critique of the ecosystem services and REDD+ approaches								DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE				46				23	36		10.5380/dma.v46i0.54187				AUG 2018	2018	Greenhouse gas emissions are one of the biggest human impacts on the planet and are directly related to climate change. Emissions from deforestation are acknowledge as the second biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for up to 20% of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere in 2010. One of the main strategies internationally adopted to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, which is now gaining importance for the climate change mitigation, is the implementation of protected areas. The current paradigm of protected area management is based on market instruments, exemplified by the REDD + initiatives and payment for ecosystem services schemes. However, critics of this perspective argue that it is directly influenced by neoliberalism and privileges capital accumulation over the conservation of the environment. Through a critical analysis of the existing literature, the present article suggests that protected areas are an efficient strategy for reducing deforestation, but it is still insufficient and needs to be accompanied by complementary actions for the control of territories outside protected areas, which prevents the redirection of illegal activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	16	1518-952X	2176-9109		WOS:000443496600002		J	Lei Hongdou; Li Shiping; Li Hao								Existing agricultural ecosystem in China leads to environmental pollution: an econometric approach								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				25	24			24488	24499		10.1007/s11356-018-2461-9				AUG 2018	2018	Sustainable agriculture ensures food security and prevents starvation. However, the need to meet the increasing food demands of the growing population has led to poor and unsustainable agricultural practices, which promote environmental degradation. Given the contributions of agricultural ecosystems to environmental pollution, we investigated the impact of the agricultural ecosystem on environmental pollution in China using time series data from 1960 to 2014. We employed several methods for econometric analysis including the unit root test, Johansen test of cointegration, Granger causality test, and vector error correction model. Evidence based on the long-run elasticity indicates that a 1% increase in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent to nitrous oxide from synthetic fertilizers will increase the emissions of CO2 by 1.52% in the long run. Similarly, a 1% increase in the area of harvested rice paddy, cereal production, biomass of burned crop residues, and agricultural GDP will increase the carbon dioxide emissions by 0.85, 0.63, 0.37, and 0.22%, respectively. The estimated results indicate that there are long-term equilibrium relationships among the selected variables considered for the agricultural ecosystem and carbon dioxide emissions. In particular, we identified bidirectional causal associations between CO2 emissions, biomass of burned crop residues, and cereal production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	5	14	0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000441784000088	29909537	J	Hossain, Md Faruque								Photon application in the design of sustainable buildings to console global energy and environment								APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING				141				579	588		10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.05.085				AUG 2018	2018	Photon energy has been implemented to design the sustainable building where at least 25% of its exterior curtain skin wall could be used as the acting Photovoltaics (PV) panel to trap the solar energy to transform into electricity to satisfy energy demand for a building itself without any outsource connection.

It comprises approximately 2 million km(2) and is divided into 22 ecoregions, based on environmental conditions and vegetation. The most dominant vegetation type is cerrado sensu stricto (cerrado ss), a savanna woodland. Quantifying variation of biomass density of this vegetation is crucial for climate change mitigation policies. Integrating remote sensing data with adequate allometric equations and field-based data sets can provide large-scale estimates of biomass. We developed individual-tree aboveground biomass (AGB) allometric models to compare different regression techniques and explanatory variables. We applied the model with the strongest fit to a comprehensive ground-based data set (77 sites, 893 plots, and 95,484 trees) to describe AGB density variation of cerrado ss. We also investigated the influence of physiographic and climatological variables on AGB density; this analysis was restricted to 68 sites because eight sites could not be classified into a specific ecoregion, and one site had no soil texture data. In addition, we developed two models to estimate plot AGB density based on plot basal area. Our data show that for individual-tree AGB models a) log-log linear models provided better estimates than nonlinear power models; b) including species as a random effect improved model fit; c) diameter at 30 cm above ground was a reliable predictor for individual-tree AGB, and although height significantly improved model fit, species wood density did not. Mean tree AGB density in cerrado ss was 22.9 tons ha(-1) (95% confidence interval = +/- 2.2) and varied widely between ecoregions (8.8 to 42.2 tons ha(-1)), within ecoregions (e.g. 4.8 to 39.5 tons ha(-1)), and even within sites (24.3 to 69.9 tons ha(-1)). Biomass density tended to be higher in sites close to the Amazon. Ecoregion explained 42% of biomass variation between the 68 sites (P < 0.01) and shows strong potential as a parameter for classifying regional biomass variation in the Cerrado.									1	0	0	1	0	1	2	17	1932-6203			WOS:000440415500002	30067735	J	Holland, Robert A.; Beaumont, Nicola; Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie; Gross, Robert J.

Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of forty influential energy and ecosystem services scenario exercises, we consider how the benefits to society that are derived from the natural environment are integrated within current energy scenarios. The analysis demonstrates a set of common underlying themes across scenario exercises. These include the relative contribution of fossil sources of energy, rates of decarbonisation, the level of international cooperation and globalisation, rate of technological development and deployment, and societies focus on environmental sustainability. Across energy scenario exercises, ecosystem services consideration is primarily limited to climate regulation, food, water resources, and air quality. In contrast, ecosystem services scenarios consider energy systems in a highly aggregated narrative form, with impacts of energy options mediated primarily through climate and land use change. Emerging data and tools offer opportunities for closer integration of energy and ecosystem services scenarios. This can be achieved by incorporating into scenarios exercises both monetary and non-monetary values of ecosystem services, and increasing the spatial representation of both energy systems and ecosystem services. The importance of ecosystem services for human well-being is increasingly recognised in policy at local, national and international scales. Tighter integration of energy and ecosystem service scenarios exercises will allow policy makers to identify pathways consistent with international obligations relating to both anthropogenic climate change and the loss and degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services.									4	0	0	1	0	4	0	10	0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000436215500063		J	Morgan, M.

Whether it could do so in its current form is a critical question: Existing large light water reactors in the United States are under economic pressure from low natural gas prices, and some have already closed. Moreover, because of their great cost and complexity, it appears most unlikely that any new large plants will be built over the next several decades. While advanced reactor designs are sometimes held up as a potential solution to nuclear power's challenges, our assessment of the advanced fission enterprise suggests that no US design will be commercialized before midcentury. That leaves factory-manufactured, light water small modular reactors (SMRs) as the only option that might be deployed at significant scale in the climate-critical period of the next several decades. We have systematically investigated how a domestic market could develop to support that industry over the next several decades and, in the absence of a dramatic change in the policy environment, have been unable to make a convincing case. Achieving deep decarbonization of the energy system will require a portfolio of every available technology and strategy we can muster. It should be a source of profound concern for all who care about climate change that, for entirely predictable and resolvable reasons, the United States appears set to virtually lose nuclear power, and thus a wedge of reliable and low-carbon energy, over the next few decades.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	11	0027-8424			WOS:000438050900044	29967141	J	Damert, Matthias; Baumgartner, Rupert J.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				25	4			473	488		10.1002/csr.1473				JUL-AUG 2018	2018	To prevent adverse effects from climate change, it is vital to involve the private sector in mitigation efforts. So far, however, research has insufficiently addressed the determinants of corporate action in specific industries. Our paper aims at bridging this gap by empirically analyzing the global automotive industry's response to climate change mitigation issues. We use publicly available information from 105 sector leaders to investigate the role of external institutional pressures and intra-organizational governance in the extent of corporate action. Based on a multiple regression analysis, we find that organizational involvement and the integration of climate change into risk management exhibit the greatest influence. Moreover, companies with business activities that necessitate interaction with the end consumer tend to be most active. Our analysis furthermore indicates that neither the stringency of a firm's home country's climate policy regime nor the degree of internationalization is associated with a higher implementation level of response strategies.

However, the carbon uptake potential in land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly uncertain. Here, we address this uncertainty by using two land-based mitigation scenarios from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) as input to four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; LPJ-GUESS, ORCHIDEE, JULES, LPJmL). Each of the four combinations of land-use models and mitigation scenarios aimed for a cumulative carbon uptake of 130 GtC by the end of the century, achieved either via the cultivation of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or avoided deforestation and afforestation (ADAFF). Results suggest large uncertainty in simulated future land demand and carbon uptake rates, depending on the assumptions related to land use and land management in the models. Total cumulative carbon uptake in the DGVMs is highly variable across mitigation scenarios, ranging between 19 and 130 GtC by year 2099. Only one out of the 16 combinations of mitigation scenarios and DGVMs achieves an equivalent or higher carbon uptake than achieved in the land-use models. The large differences in carbon uptake between the DGVMs and their discrepancy against the carbon uptake in IMAGE and MAgPIE are mainly due to different model assumptions regarding bioenergy crop yields and due to the simulation of soil carbon response to land-use change. Differences between land-use models and DGVMs regarding forest biomass and the rate of forest regrowth also have an impact, albeit smaller, on the results. Given the low confidence in simulated carbon uptake for a given land-based mitigation scenario, and that negative emissions simulated by the DGVMs are typically lower than assumed in scenarios consistent with the 2 degrees C target, relying on negative emissions to mitigate climate change is a highly uncertain strategy.									7	0	0	1	0	7	8	50	1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000437281500024	29569788	J	Kurz, Verena								Nudging to reduce meat consumption: Immediate and persistent effects of an intervention at a university restaurant								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT				90				317	341		10.1016/j.jeem.2018.06.005				JUL 2018	2018	Reducing meat consumption is considered to have great potential to mitigate food-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. I conducted a field experiment with two restaurants to test if nudging can increase the consumption of vegetarian food. At the treated restaurant, the salience of the vegetarian option was increased by changing the menu order and enhancing the visibility of the vegetarian dish. The other restaurant served as a control. Daily sales data on the three main dishes sold were collected from September 2015 until June 2016.

However, little evidence exists in China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter and most populated country. As China is embracing an aging population with changing population size and falling age-standardized mortality rates, the potential impact of population change on ozone-related health burdens is unclear. Moreover, little is known about the seasonal variation of ozone-related health burdens under climate change. We aimed to assess near-term (mid-21st century) future annual and seasonal excess mortality from short-term exposure to ambient ozone in 104 Chinese cities under 2 climate and emission change scenarios and 6 population change scenarios.Methods and findingsWe collected historical ambient ozone observations, population change projections, and baseline mortality rates in 104 cities across China during April 27, 2013, to October 31, 2015 (2013-2015), which included approximately 13% of the total population of mainland China. Using historical ozone monitoring data, we performed bias correction and spatially down-scaled future ozone projections at a coarse spatial resolution (2.0 degrees x 2.5 degrees) for the period April 27, 2053, to October 31, 2055 (2053-2055), from a global chemistry-climate model to a fine spatial resolution (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) under 2 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5, a moderate global warming and emission scenario where global warming is between 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, and RCP8.5, a high global warming and emission scenario where global warming exceeds 2.0 degrees C. We then estimated the future annual and seasonal ozone-related acute excess mortality attributable to both climate and population changes using cause-specific, age-group-specific, and season-specific concentration-response functions (CRFs). We used Monte Carlo simulations to obtain empirical confidence intervals (eCIs), quantifying the uncertainty in CRFs and the variability across ensemble members (i.e., 3 predictions of future climate and air quality from slightly different starting conditions) of the global model. Estimates of future changes in annual ozone-related mortality are sensitive to the choice of global warming and emission scenario, decreasing under RCP4.5 (-24.0%) due to declining ozone precursor emissions but increasing under RCP8.5 (10.7%) due to warming climate in 2053-2055 relative to 2013-2015. Higher ambient ozone occurs under the high global warming and emission scenario (RCP8.5), leading to an excess 1,476 (95% eCI: 898 to 2,977) non-accidental deaths per year in 2053-2055 relative to 2013-2015. Future ozone-related acute excess mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 5-8 times greater than that from respiratory diseases. Ozone concentrations increase by 15.1 parts per billion (10(-9)) in colder months (November to April), contributing to a net yearly increase of 22.3% (95% eCI: 7.7% to 35.4%) in ozone-related mortality under RCP8.5. An aging population, with the proportion of the population aged 65 years and above increased from 8% in 2010 to 24%-33% in 2050, will substantially amplify future ozone-related mortality, leading to a net increase of 23,838 to 78,560 deaths (110% to 363%). Our analysis was mainly limited by using a single global chemistry-climate model and the statistical downscaling approach to project ozone changes under climate change.ConclusionsOur analysis shows increased future ozone-related acute excess mortality under the high global warming and emission scenario RCP8.5 for an aging population in China. Comparison with the lower global warming and emission scenario RCP4.5 suggests that climate change mitigation measures are needed to prevent a rising health burden from exposure to ambient ozone pollution in China.									6	0	0	4	0	6	7	38	1549-1277	1549-1676		WOS:000440339700006	29969446	J	Tienhaara, Kyla					Tienhaara, Kyla/0000-0001-7148-7686			Regulatory Chill in a Warming World: The Threat to Climate Policy Posed by Investor-State Dispute Settlement								TRANSNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW				7	2			229	250		10.1017/S2047102517000309				JUL 2018	2018	The system of investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) found in over 3,000 bilateral investment treaties and numerous regional trade agreements has been criticized for interfering with the rights of sovereign states to regulate investment in the public interest, for example, to protect the environment and public health. This article argues that while much of the public debate around ISDS has focused on a small number of cases that have arisen over the regulation of tobacco packaging, there is a far greater threat posed by the potential use of ISDS by the fossil fuel industry to stall action on climate change. It is hypothesized that fossil fuel corporations will emulate a tactic employed by the tobacco industry - that of using ISDS to induce cross-border regulatory chill: the delay in policy uptake in jurisdictions outside the jurisdiction in which the ISDS claim is brought. Importantly, fossil fuel corporations do not have to win any ISDS cases for this strategy to be effective; they only have to be willing to launch them. The article concludes with three options to reform trade and investment agreements to better align them with climate change mitigation efforts: (i) exclude ISDS provisions; (ii) prohibit fossil fuel industries from accessing ISDS; or (iii) carve out all government measures taken in pursuit of international obligations (for example, under the Paris Agreement on climate change) from challenge under ISDS.									9	0	0	0	0	9	0	4	2047-1025	2047-1033		WOS:000438047900003		J	Crow, Susan E.; Sierra, Carlos A.								Dynamic, Intermediate Soil Carbon Pools May Drive Future Responsiveness to Environmental Change								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY				47	4			607	616		10.2134/jeq2017.07.0280				JUL-AUG 2018	2018	Accurately capturing dynamic soil response to disturbance effects in agroecosystem models remains elusive, thereby limiting projections of climate change mitigation potential. Perennial grasses cultivated in zero-tillage management systems hold promise as sustainable agroecosystems. High-yielding tropical C-4 grasses often have extensive rooting systems, and the belowground processes of root turnover, aggregate formation, and mineral stabilization drove rapid C accumulation after cultivation in a recent study. We sought (i) to understand and constrain the size and responsiveness of dynamic, intermediate-cycling C pools contributing to the observed C accrual rates, and (ii) to simulate C stocks over time under the disturbance of elevated temperature using soil incubation at multiple temperatures and physical fractionation via density and sonication. Three-pool transfer modeling of soil incubations revealed small pools of readily available (i.e., days to months) microbial substrate that were responsive to temperature, time since cultivation, and inputs. Larger, kinetically slow-cycling pools were more indicative of long-term (i.e., years to decades) changes in C stock and strongly connected to measured changes in physical fractions. Combining the sensitivity of readily available microbial substrate with three-pool transfer modeling of the physical fractions over time since cultivation revealed that dynamic transfers of inputs occurred between the free organic and aggregate-protected fractions, and from these fractions to the mineral-associated dense fraction. Under 5 degrees C temperature elevation, increased transfer rates outweighed elevated decomposition losses to sustain soil C accrual into the future. To effectively plan managed landscapes and monitor sustainable agroecosystems for climate change mitigation, tools must incorporate the complexity of soil response to change.									2	0	0	2	0	2	1	6	0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000445082700004	30025040	J	Robertson, Andy D.; Zhang, Yao; Sherrod, Lucretia A.; Rosenzweig, Steven T.; Ma, Liwang; Ahuja, Lajpat; Schipanski, Meagan E.

We examined productivity and soil C dynamics under two climate change scenarios (moderate warming, representative concentration pathway [RCP] 4.5; and high warming, RCP 8.5), using long-term experimental data and the DayCent process-based model for three sites with varying climates and soil conditions in the US High Plains. Each site included a no-till cropping intensity gradient introduced in 1985, with treatments ranging from wheat-fallow (Triticum aestivum L.) to continuous annual cropping and perennial grass. Simulations were extended to 2100 using data from 16 global circulation models to estimate uncertainty. Simulated yields declined for all crops (up to 50% for wheat), with small changes after 2050 under RCP 4.5 and continued losses to 2100 under RCP 8.5. Of the cropped systems, continuous cropping had the highest average productivity and soil C sequestration rates (78.1 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) from 2015 to 2045 under RCP 4.5). Any increase in soil C for cropped rotations was realized by 2050, but grassland treatments increased soil C (up to 69%) through 2100, even under RCP 8.5. Our simulations indicate that reduced frequency of summer fallow can both increase annualized yields and store more soil C. As evapotranspiration is likely to increase, reducing fallow periods without live vegetation from dryland agricultural rotations may enhance the resilience of these systems to climate change while also increasing soil C storage and mitigating carbon dioxide emissions.									6	0	0	3	0	6	3	15	0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000445082700012	30025064	J	Byrnes, Ryan C.; Eastburn, Danny J.; Tate, Kenneth W.; Roche, Leslie M.								A Global Meta-Analysis of Grazing Impacts on Soil Health Indicators								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY				47	4			758	765		10.2134/jeq2017.08.0313				JUL-AUG 2018	2018	Grazing lands support the livelihoods of millions of people across nearly one-half of the globe. Soils are the backbone of stability and resilience in these systems. To determine livestock grazing impacts on soil health, we conducted a global meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, C/N ratio, and bulk density responses to grazing strategies (continuous, rotational, and no grazing) and intensities (heavy, moderate, and light grazing) from 64 studies around the world. Across all studies and grazing intensities, continuous grazing significantly reduced SOC, C/N, and total N compared with no grazing. Soil compaction (i.e., increased bulk density) was greater under both continuous and rotational grazing compared with no grazing; however, rotational grazing had lower bulk density than continuous grazing. Rotational grazing had greater SOC than continuous grazing and was not different from no grazing. The positive responses of SOC to rotational grazing could create climate change mitigation opportunities. Grazing strategy comparisons were minimally conditioned by aridity class (i.e., arid, subhumid, and humid); however, complete observations were notably limited or missing for many rotational grazing comparisons. For continuous and no grazing strategy comparisons, we found that grazing management can significantly influence soil function and health outcomes; however, site-specific environmental factors play important moderating roles. Greater coordination across regional, national, and global efforts, as well as consistent guidelines for soil health evaluation, would help overcome these knowledge gaps and vastly improve our collective understanding of grazing impacts on soil health, providing greater management and policy impacts.									5	0	0	5	0	5	7	24	0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000445082700020	30025044	J	Lalonde, Seth J.; Mach, Katharine J.; Anderson, Christa M.; Francis, Emily J.; Sanchez, Daniel L.; Stanton, Charlotte Y.; Turner, Peter A.; Field, Christopher B.								Forest management in the Sierra Nevada provides limited carbon storage potential: an expert elicitation								ECOSPHERE				9	7					e02321	10.1002/ecs2.2321				JUL 2018	2018	Analysis of long-term trends in forest carbon stocks is challenged by interactions among climate change, wildfire and other disturbances, forest management actions, and heterogeneous vegetation responses. For such circumstances where complex interactions make it difficult to encompass the full range of processes in any one mode of analysis, expert elicitation is a well-developed method for documenting judgments about uncertainty, based on available evidence, to inform ongoing decision-making. Applying this method for the Sierra Nevada, we evaluate subjective probabilistic estimates of trends in aboveground forest carbon for different management scenarios toward the goal of maximizing carbon stored, while also considering implications for wildfire risk. The analysis examines the effects of four treatments in isolation (thinning, timber harvesting, prescribed burning, managed wildfire), as well as a user-defined management portfolio allocating resources across five management practices (thinning, harvesting, prescribed burning, firefighting, and restoration). The expert elicitation suggests that aboveground forest carbon stocks will decline 8%, from 126 to 116 tC/ha, between 2030 and 2100 (median estimate across experts) assuming conventional forest management practices are continued. Out of all surveyed practices, the custom user-defined management portfolio results in the highest carbon stock of 129 tC/ha which is 11% higher than conventional practice in 2100 at the 50th percentile. The expert elicitation indicates less beneficial carbon sequestration outcomes than recent modeling studies. Suggesting co-benefits across objectives, 75 experts collectively estimate a 61% likelihood that managing for carbon also reduces wildfire risk. By contrast, decreases in carbon stocks are anticipated for large magnitudes of climate change or substantial decreases in forest management investments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	11	2150-8925			WOS:000441526900019		J	Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla; Pekkonen, Maria; Leivo, Virpi; Prasauskas, Tadas; Turunen, Mari; Kiviste, Mihkel; Aaltonen, Anu; Martuzevicius, Dainius				Leivo, Virpi/X-3117-2019; Martuzevicius, Dainius/A-7673-2010; Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla/O-5688-2015; Kiviste, Mihkel/H-4109-2016	Leivo, Virpi/0000-0001-6627-5187; Martuzevicius, Dainius/0000-0002-7403-4196; Haverinen-Shaughnessy, Ulla/0000-0002-9456-7256; Kiviste, Mihkel/0000-0001-8726-070X			Occupant satisfaction with indoor environmental quality and health after energy retrofits of multi-family buildings: Results from INSULAtE-project								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH				221	6			921	928		10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.05.009				JUL 2018	2018	Background: Driven by climate change mitigation, EU countries are committed to improve energy efficiency of their building stock by implementing the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD). Should higher energy efficiency result in better indoor environmental quality (IEQ), this policy could also be seen as an opportunity to improve public health across Europe.Objectives: This paper focuses on the assessment of the effects of energy retrofits on occupant satisfaction with IEQ and health in multifamily buildings.Methods: Data on occupant satisfaction with IEQ and health were collected from the occupants of 39 Finnish and 15 Lithuanian multifamily buildings (an average of five apartments per building, one adult per apartment) both before and after energy retrofits (such as improving thermal insulation, windows, heating and/or ventilation systems). Parallel to the data collected from the occupants, data on several IEQ parameters, including temperature, temperature factor, and air change rate, were collected from their apartments. Moreover, data from seven Finnish and five Lithuanian non-retrofitted control buildings were collected according to the same protocol.Results: Occupant satisfaction regarding indoor temperature was associated with both retrofit status (OR 5.3, 95% CI 2.6-11.0) and measured IEQ parameters (indoor temperature OR 1.4 per 1 degrees C increase, temperature factor OR 1.1 per 1% increase, and air change rate OR 5.6 per 1/h increase). Additional positive associations were found between retrofit status and occupants reporting absence of upper respiratory symptoms (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9) as well as not missing work or school due to respiratory infections (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.2-13.8), however, these associations were independent of the measured IEQ parameters.Conclusions: There seems to be a strong subjective component related to the observed changes in occupant satisfaction with IEQ and health as a result of energy retrofitting in buildings. Further studies are needed to verify the actual mechanisms, as well as possible long term effects.									3	0	0	0	0	3	3	11	1438-4639	1618-131X		WOS:000440772700008	29859666	J	Serna-Chavez, Hector M.; Kissling, W.

However, studies on ecosystem services usually ignore this. Here, we test how the importance of factors related to climate regulation services varies with spatial extent (i.e., area of assessment) and how covariation among factors affects scale dependencies.Location: The Americas.Time period: Present.Major taxa studied: Plants.Methods: We combined a multi-model inference framework with variance partitioning to quantify the importance of factors that could potentially influence climate regulation services (i.e., albedo, evapotranspiration and primary productivity). We quantified abiotic (climate, soil, heterogeneity in soils/topography), biotic (open vegetation, forest area and biomass,plant functional traits) and anthropogenic (forest fragmentation, managed vegetation, non-vegetated surfaces) conditions and tested their importance in relation to climate regulation services at spatial extents ranging from 9 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(6) km(2).Results: We found that the importance of abiotic factors in relation to climate regulation services increases with spatial extent. However, we found no evidence for a change from primarily biotically to abiotically driven climate regulation services with increasing spatial extent. All spatial extent dependencies were heavily influenced by covariation between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. After accounting for covariation, we found a primacy of abiotic factors as drivers of climate regulation services across spatial extents. Biotic and anthropogenic factors were less important than abiotic factors, and their independent effects were conserved across spatial extents.Main conclusions: Our results show that the relative importance of abiotic factors related to climate regulation services depends on spatial extent. Biotic and anthropogenic factors are less important for climate regulation services than abiotic factors, and this hierarchy is scale invariant. Our findings suggest that spatial extent dependence needs to be quantified and assessed in climate-change mitigation projects that focus on ecosystem services.									1	0	0	0	0	1	2	10	1466-822X	1466-8238		WOS:000439785700006		J	Balagizi, Charles M.; Kasereka, Marcellin M.; Cuoco, Emilio; Liotta, Marcello				Liotta, Marcello/C-4974-2012	Liotta, Marcello/0000-0002-7203-1565; Balagizi, Charles/0000-0003-0313-2626			Influence of moisture source dynamics and weather patterns on stable isotopes ratios of precipitation in Central-Eastern Africa								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				628-629				1058	1078		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.01.284				JUL 1 2018	2018	We report the first delta O-18 and delta H-2 data of Virunga rainfall in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, situated on the limit between Central and Eastern Africa. The dataset is from 13 rain gauges deployed at Mount Nyiragongo and its surroundings sampled monthly between December 2013 and October 2015. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 vary from -6.44 to 6.16%., and -32.53 to 58.89%., respectively, and allowed us to define a LMWL of delta H-2 = 7.60 delta O-18 + 16.18. Three main wind directions, i.e. NE, E and SE, were identified in the upper atmosphere corresponding to three major moisture source regions. On the contrary, lower atmospheric winds are weaker in nature and originate mainly from the S and SW, creating a topographically-driven, more local moisture regime. The latter is due to the accumulation in the floor of the rift of water vapor from Lake Kivu forming a layer of isotopically enriched vapor that mediates the isotope enrichment of the falling raindrops. A strong seasonality is observed in both delta O-18 and delta H-2 data, and is primarily driven by combined seasonal and spatial variation in the moisture sources. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 seasonality is thus correlated to weather patterns, as the latter control the wet to dry season shifting, and vice versa. The key characteristic of seasonality is the variation of monthly precipitation amounts, since the mean monthly air temperature is nearly constant on an annual scale. Two regionally relevant hydrological processes contribute to the isotopic signature: namely moisture uptake from the isotopically enriched surface waters of East African lakes and from the depleted soil-water and plants. Consequently, the proportion of water vapor from each of these reservoirs in the atmosphere drives the enrichment or depletion of delta H-2 and delta O-18 in the precipitation. Thus, during wet periods the vapor from soil-plants evapotranspiration dominates yielding isotopically depleted precipitation, contrary to dry periods when vapor from lakes surface evaporation dominates, yielding isotopically enriched precipitation. At the global scale, our dataset reduces gaps in this region that has been poorly studied for delta O-18 and delta H-2 in precipitation. At the regional scale, the improved understanding of the ways land cover, moisture source seasonal and spatial dynamics, and atmospheric patterns impact precipitation spatial and temporal variabilities in Central-East African will contribute to the ongoing research on mitigating the impacts of ongoing climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. The reduction of gaps and uncertainties in delta H-2 and delta O-18 of precipitation, and the understanding of their interrelation with weather patterns are essential for a better past, present and future environmental and climatic modelling at both local and regional scales.

Four commercial grade biochars were evaluated as peat substitute. Biochars were characterised for plant nutrients and for biological stability. The results showed that there were negligible quantities of N and P and generally high levels of K and high biological stability. When these materials were mixed with peat at 10, 25 and 50% and nutrients were added to bring them to the same level of nutrients as in fertilized peat, it was found that biochar mixtures considerably reduced the levels of calcium chloride/DTPA (CAT) extractable N (including nitrate), P, and electrical conductivity greater extent with higher rates of biochar addition except for K. The pH and K levels were increased with biochar addition. The drop in EC has important implications regarding the use of other materials used to dilute peat, for example, corn posted green waste, the rate of dilution is limited due to high EC and biochar addition gives the potential for higher peat dilution of these materials. Nitrate and phosphorus are very vulnerable to leaching of these nutrients in the environment in peat substrates and the binding of these by biochar has implication for leaching and nutrient application strategy. Root development using Cress test and tomato plant height and biomass using containers, were in some cases better than peat indicating that biochar could be used to dilute peat e.g. for seedling production where root development and rapid growth are very important. Application of biochars resulted in a marked reduction of N (and P) in the plant. There were significant correlation between CAT extractable N and P and corresponding plant concentration, indicating the standard growing media test, CAT, would be suitable for assessing the nutrient status of peat biochar mixes.

Australia is a global hotspot for seaweed biodiversity with a rich, diverse Indigenous history dating back 65,000 years, including an extensive traditional knowledge of Australian natural resources. In our present review of archival literature, we explored the contemporary and historical uses and cultural significance of seaweeds to Indigenous Australians. We found records of seaweed use by Indigenous Saltwater Australians (Australian Aboriginal peoples from coastal areas across the nation who are the Traditional Owners/Guardians and custodians of the lands and waters characterised by saltwater environment) for a variety of purposes including cultural activities, ceremonial activities, medicinal uses, clothing, cultural history, food, fishing, shelter and domestic uses. Species-specific records were rarely recorded (and/or accurately translated) in the archival literature, with the exception of the use of the fucoid bull kelp, Durvillaea potatorum, which was prevalent. Our research is a step forward in the important task of recovering and conserving Indigenous Australian knowledge and customary traditions surrounding coastal resource use. Unlocking this knowledge creates opportunities for the continuance and revitalization of traditional customary practises that may enable innovative Indigenous business activities and product creation, based around food, sustainable natural-fibre technologies and health. Such research also has the potential to enhance a developing Australian seaweed industry by guiding species selection, preparation, use and sustainable resource management. We recommend our findings are used to inform the direction and locations of further research conducted in conjunction with Indigenous coastal communities in Australia's temperate regions, to explore in more detail the Indigenous Australian's historical heritage associated with coastal seaweed resources and their uses.									4	0	0	2	0	4	4	15	0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000433966200033		J	Fitzgerald, Jared B.; Schor, Juliet B.; Jorgenson, Andrew K.

Within this degrowth approach, working time reduction is a key policy lever to reduce emissions as well as protect employment. In the United States, the abdication of responsibility for mitigation by the federal government has led to the emergence of state climate leadership. This study is the first to analyze the relationship between emissions and working hours at the state level. Our findings suggest that over the 2007-2013 period, state-level carbon emissions and average working hours have a strong, positive relationship, which holds across a variety of model estimation techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic drivers of emissions. We conclude that working time reduction may represent a multiple dividend policy, contributing to enhanced quality of life and lower unemployment as well as emissions mitigation.									12	0	0	1	0	12	2	11	0037-7732	1534-7605		WOS:000434097300025		J	Lechon, Yolanda; De La Rua, Cristina; Cabal, Helena				de la Rua, Cristina/H-9957-2015	de la Rua, Cristina/0000-0002-8659-8765			Impacts of Decarbonisation on the Water-Energy-Land (WEL) Nexus: A Case Study of the Spanish Electricity Sector								ENERGIES				11	5					1203	10.3390/en11051203				MAY 2018	2018	Over the last decades, combating climate change has been an important concern for policy makers.

Being electricity generation the focus of climate change mitigation policies, important changes are expected in this sector over the next few years as a result of the implementation of such policies. However, electricity production also generates other impacts on the water, energy and land (WEL) nexus that must be further investigated. To shed some light to this issue, this paper presents and discusses the potential impacts on the water-energy-land nexus resulting from the decarbonisation of the Spanish electricity system impacts under two different long-term scenarios. Using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, a set of environmental impacts relevant for the nexus have been analysed for the current and future electricity generation technologies in Spain. Additionally, through the use of an optimization energy model-Times-Spain-the evolution of the electricity technologies in Spain until 2030, under two different scenarios and targets has been assessed. Taking into consideration such scenarios, the global warming, acidification, eutrophication, ecotoxicity, water consumption, resource depletion and land use impacts have been estimated. Results show that, over time, together with the decrease of greenhouse gas emission, acidification and eutrophication tend to decrease in both scenarios. On the contrary, ecotoxicity and resource use impacts tend to increase.									1	0	0	1	0	1	1	8	1996-1073			WOS:000435610300181		J	Wang, Nana; Feng, Yuchuan; Liu, Liang; Guo, Xin								Effects of preparation methods on the structure and property of Al-stabilized CaO-based sorbents for CO2 capture								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				173				276	284		10.1016/j.fuproc.2018.02.005				MAY 2018	2018	CaO-based sorbents are promising candidates for CO2 capture at high temperatures via Ca looping systems. This work aims to examine the effects of preparation methods on the microstructure and performance of Al-stabilized CaO-based sorbents for capturing CO2. Different preparation techniques including wet mixing, co-precipitation and sol-gel auto-combustion synthesis were employed to prepare the A1(2)O(3)-stabilized Ca-based sorbents with various mass ratios of components. Changes in CO2 absorbing capacity and stability were clearly observed for the sorbents prepared with different methods. Field scanning electron microscope and N-2 adsorption and desorption isotherms analyses showed that the preparation methods tended to impact the morphology and porosity of the sorbents, hence affecting the adsorption capacity. The (27)A1 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the mixed oxides revealed that the sorbents prepared from different methods all contained the same structural units of tetrahedral Al site (A1O(4)), but with obviously different intensity and broad shoulder peak. This demonstrated that the micro domain environment of (27)A1 atoms residing in the lattice could be effectively modified by the doping methods.									1	0	0	0	0	1	9	33	0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000429398400031		J	Malek, Ziga; Verburg, Peter H.; Geijzendorffer, Ilse R.; Bondeau, Alberte; Cramer, Wolfgang				Bondeau, Alberte/E-9909-2012; Cramer, Wolfgang/B-8221-2008; Cramer, Wolfgang/O-2836-2019; Verburg, Peter H/Z-1582-2019; Malek, Ziga/I-2517-2019; Verburg, Peter/A-8469-2010	Cramer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9205-5812; Cramer, Wolfgang/0000-0002-9205-5812; Malek, Ziga/0000-0002-6981-6708; Verburg, Peter/0000-0002-6977-7104; Geijzendorffer, Ilse R./0000-0002-8471-7695			Global change effects on land management in the Mediterranean region								GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS				50				238	254		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.04.007				MAY 2018	2018	The Mediterranean region faces significant challenges to supply its growing population with food and living space. The region's potential to do so in the future is even more uncertain in the light of global change effects. Climate change will impact water availability in the region, which is already limited and often used at unsustainable rates. To investigate the effects of global change and explore alternative development pathways of Mediterranean land use, we simulated two future scenarios with different land, water and biodiversity management transitions. We adopted a land systems approach, where land use and land cover are combined with data on land management, irrigation and livestock density, taking into account the characteristics of Mediterranean multifunctional landscapes, specific agricultural products, such as permanent crops, and irrigation water demands. Future land system changes were explored using the CLUMondo model for different development pathways of the region. We constrained the withdrawal of irrigation water based on existing freshwater resources. In a 'growth' scenario, we simulated a hypothetical future without consideration of environmental constraints and where food production and urban expansion are main priorities. The 'sustainability' scenario represents a future where limited water resources are extracted in a sustainable way and where areas of high biodiversity value are protected. The growth scenario projected significant intensification of land management, and loss of agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic systems. To achieve this, we calculate that the region would need to increase water withdrawal for irrigation significantly, resulting in increased pressure on freshwater resources. The sustainability scenario presents a way of increasing food production and at the same time improving the state of water resources, wetlands and traditional landscapes. Achieving this future would require improvements of yields of rain-fed systems and efficiencies of irrigated systems. The results indicate that coordinated environmental policy together with appropriate market access are needed to steer the regions land management towards a more sustainable future while ensuring food production.									9	1	0	2	0	11	4	31	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000436223800020		J	Akinyoyenu, Afolabi Festus; Bin Majid, Mohammad Rafee; Zen, Irina Safitri								Botanical Gardens as Drivers of Climate Change Mitigation and Urban Sustainability in Ondo-State, Nigeria								ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS				24	5			3733	3739		10.1166/asl.2018.11475				MAY 2018	2018	The increasing pace of urbanisation implies that the fate of urban biotic communities, of which the local botanical gardens are a vital part, will continue to hang in the balance. The disappearance of plants from urban environments often endangers humans, reduces urban cooling and increases global warming and climate change. Consequently, threats to botanical gardens often provoke negative impacts on human ability to resuscitate and restore damaged native plant species, and invoke greater damage on the environment from permanent loss of plant conservation and genetic diversity. Threats to botanical gardens provoke negative impacts on human ability to resuscitate and restore damaged native plant species, as well as invoke greater damage on the environment through permanent loss of plant conservation and genetic diversity. This paper utilises site visits, oral and telephone interviews of eleven (11) botanical garden operators from the three geopolitical zones of the State, and published sources during the study. It was revealed that poor awareness and funding, lack of interaction, and non-implementation of botanical gardens criteria, are some of the problems facing botanical garden operators in the State. To date, attempts at linking the local botanical gardens to climate change mitigation and urban sustainability in Ondo-State is lacking, Policy measures that target the identified administrative and technical lapses identified are therefore recommended.

Estimates of future woody biomass demands vary in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), depending on societal development trends, climate model projections, socioeconomic conditions, and climate and energy policies. The SSPs are qualitatively and quantitatively defined at global and macro-regional level, and their implementation for individual sectors at a national basis is challenging. In this paper, we provide estimates for forest wood outtakes in Norway until 2100 using key drivers from the SSPs such as population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and specific aspects of developments in the land use sector. First, we analyze historical wood harvest trends from 1960 to 2016 for the main tree species and wood classes and construct a regression model based on population, GDP and time. The model framework is based on a statistical approach that does not explicitly include market adjustments, but it is adapted to an interpretation of the salient characteristics of the different SSP scenarios to estimate future outtake volumes for each combination of tree species and wood classes in Norway. The SSP characteristics implemented in the model framework are GDP and population, land-use change regulation, participation of the land-use sector to climate change mitigation, and starting year of international cooperation for climate change mitigation. The produced estimates span a range of possible harvest rates and resource use potentials. Results show that SSP1 achieves a maximum mean extraction rate of 17.7 million m(3) (in 2090). Forest wood outtake volumes are the lowest in SSP3, reaching a maximum of about 11.9 million m(3) in 2040 and then declining. SSP2 and SSP4 generally lie in between SSP1 and SSP3. SSP5 is the most resource intensive scenario, with harvest rates achieving 27.5 million m(3) in 2100. Driven by high population and GDP, SSP5 far exceeds the forest maximum harvest potential in Norway. Variability in the estimates is larger when land use regulation is weak and market fluctuations are high, such as in SSP2, SSP3 and SSP5. The proposed model framework is an approach to interpret and translate the global qualitative SSP narratives into quantitative projections at a finer scale, and can favor the use of a consistent background setting such as the SSPs in interdisciplinary research activities across different spatial scales of analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	7	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000436223800002		J	Bazan, Jose; Rieradevall, Joan; Gabarrell, Xavier; Vazquez-Rowe, Ian					Vazquez-Rowe, Ian/0000-0002-7469-2033; Rieradevall, Joan/0000-0003-3360-6829			Low-carbon electricity production through the implementation of photovoltaic panels in rooftops in urban environments: A case study for three cities in Peru								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				622				1448	1462		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.003				MAY 1 2018	2018	Urban environments in Latin America must begin decarbonizing their activities to avoid increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions rates due to their reliance on fossil fuel-based energy to support economic growth. In this context, cities in Latin America have high potential to convert sunlight into energy. Hence, the main objective of this study was to determine the potential of electricity self-sufficiency production and mitigation of GHG emissions in three medium-sized cities in Peru through the revalorization of underutilized rooftop areas in urban environments. Each city represented a distinct natural area of Peru: Pacific coast, Andean region and Amazon basin. More specifically, photovoltaic solar systems were the technology selected for implementation in these rooftop areas. Data on incident solar energy, temperature and energy consumption were collected. Thereafter, ArcGis 10.3 was used to quantify the total usable area in the cities. A series of correction factors, including tilt, orientation or roof profiles were applied to attain an accurate value of usable area. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment was the methodology chosen to calculate the reduction of environmental impacts as compared to the current context of using electricity from the regional grids. Results showed that the cities assessed have the potential to obtain their entire current electricity demand for residential, commercial and public lighting purposes, augmenting energy security and resilience to intermittent natural disasters, with the support of decentralized storage systems. This approach would also translate into substantial reductions in terms of GHG emissions. Annual reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 112 ton CO(2)eq in the city of Ayacucho to over 523 kton CO(2)eq in Pucallpa, showing that cities in the Amazon basin would be the ones that benefit the most in terms of climate change mitigation.

Paper sludge is not hazardous industrial waste mainly consisting of cellulose and calcite. Clay bodies were made from the mix containing from 5% to 20% of paper sludge and fired at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C temperatures. Open pore structure in the clay body is developed as a result of burnt cellulose fibres and calcite decarbonization. Physical and mechanical properties of clay bodies change depending on the content of added PS: shrinkage, density and compressive strength reduce, water absorption and effective porosity increase. It is recommended to add 5% of paper sludge to the clay body and fire it at 900 degrees C temperature, or alternatively add 5-15% of paper sludge and fire the clay body at 1000 degrees C temperature. In terms of resistance to freezing and thawing, such products are regarded as frost resistant in moderately aggressive environment, i.e. in structures protected from direct environmental effects.

Society also puts faith in multiple values of trees, ranging from climate change mitigation to socio-cultural traditions. Therefore, the seemingly arbitrary tree density limit for pasture environments imposed by the EU through its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) threatened both biological and societal values. In this study on farmers' perspectives, we target the effects of the CAP tree density limit on management of wood pastures in a low-intensively managed agricultural landscape of southern Sweden. The case of simplifying nature by using simple number limitations was used as an entry point in semi-structured, open-ended, interviews with farmers and officials about their view on trees and pasture management in relation to policy directives. The interviews showed that the policy incentive shifted the management focus from grazing quality to the number of trees and that farmers are willing to cut in order to get subsidies and timber revenues, however not unreflectingly. Farmers had high knowledge about the wide ranging social, cultural and natural values of trees, and are often themselves as good regulators of tree management as policies intend to be. Our study reveals many difficulties in managing the complex relations within landscapes with simplified legal measures, opening up for further discussion about improving policy instruments to preserve both social and biological values of wood pastures. However, although the tree density limit has been criticised on many points related to biodiversity conservation, this study shows that other values linked to pasture trees, e.g. the aesthetic values and their importance as shelter for grazing animals, could be an argument to actually keep the focus on trees as indicators of pasture management quality. We suggest that trees in general and wood-pastures in particular therefore are good starting points, or boundary-objects, for collaboration between production and conservation interests of farming and environmental management.

The underlying growth models are usually based on national datasets of varying size, obtained from National Forest Inventories or from long-term research plots. Many of these models include country- and location-specific predictors, such as site quality indices that may aggregate climate, soil properties and topography effects. Consequently, it is not sensible to compare such models among countries, and it is often impossible to apply models outside the region or country they were developed for. However, there is a clear need for more generically applicable but still locally accurate and climate sensitive simulators at the European scale, which requires the development of models that are applicable across the European continent. The purpose of this study is to develop tree diameter increment models that are applicable at the European scale, but still locally accurate. We compiled and used a dataset of diameter increment observations of over 2.3 million trees from 10 National Forest Inventories in Europe and a set of 99 potential explanatory variables covering forest structure, weather, climate, soil and nutrient deposition.Results: Diameter increment models are presented for 20 species/species groups. Selection of explanatory variables was done using a combination of forward and backward selection methods. The explained variance ranged from 10% to 53% depending on the species. Variables related to forest structure (basal area of the stand and relative size of the tree) contributed most to the explained variance, but environmental variables were important to account for spatial patterns. The type of environmental variables included differed greatly among species.Conclusions: The presented diameter increment models are the first of their kind that are applicable at the European scale. This is an important step towards the development of a new generation of forest development simulators that can be applied at the European scale, but that are sensitive to variations in growing conditions and applicable to a wider range of management systems than before. This allows European scale but detailed analyses concerning topics like CO2 sequestration, wood mobilisation, long term impact of management, etc.									6	1	0	2	0	7	1	11	2095-6355	2197-5620		WOS:000429291300001		J	Roughan, Brittney L.; Kellman, Lisa; Smith, Erin; Chmura, Gail L.

Excessive supply of nitrogen to salt marshes has been associated with shifts in species' distribution and production, as well as marsh degradation and loss. Our study of salt marshes in agriculturally intensive watersheds shows that coastal eutrophication can have an additional impact. We measured gas fluxes from marsh soils and verified emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) in nitrogen-loaded marshes while the reference marsh was a sink for this gas. Salt marsh soils are extremely efficient carbon sinks, but emissions of N2O, a greenhouse gas 298 times more potent than CO2, reduces the value of the carbon sink, and in some marshes, may counterbalance any value of stored carbon towards mitigation of climate change. Although more research is merited on the nitrogen transformations and carbon storage in eutrophic marshes, the possibility of significant N2O emissions should be considered when evaluating the market value of carbon in salt marshes subject to high levels of nitrogen loading.									1	0	0	1	0	1	3	13	1748-9326			WOS:000430334200001		J	Workman, Annabelle; Blashki, Grant; Bowen, Kathryn J.; Karoly, David J.; Wiseman, John				Karoly, David J/C-8262-2011	Karoly, David J/0000-0002-8671-2994; Workman, Annabelle/0000-0002-4403-614X; Bowen, Kathryn/0000-0002-2125-1963; Wiseman, John/0000-0003-2276-5517			The Political Economy of Health Co-Benefits: Embedding Health in the Climate Change Agenda								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				15	4					674	10.3390/ijerph15040674				APR 2018	2018	A complex, whole-of-economy issue such as climate change demands an interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral response. However, evidence suggests that human health has remained elusive in its influence on the development of ambitious climate change mitigation policies for many national governments, despite a recognition that the combustion of fossil fuels results in pervasive short- and long-term health consequences. We use insights from literature on the political economy of health and climate change, the science policy interface and power in policy-making, to identify additional barriers to the meaningful incorporation of health co-benefits into climate change mitigation policy development. Specifically, we identify four key interrelated areas where barriers may exist in relation to health co-benefits: discourse, efficiency, vested interests and structural challenges. With these insights in mind, we argue that the current politico-economic paradigm in which climate change is situated and the processes used to develop climate change mitigation policies do not adequately support accounting for health co-benefits. We present approaches for enhancing the role of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies to ensure that health is embedded in the broader climate change agenda.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	5	1660-4601			WOS:000434868800113	29617317	J	Balmes, John R.

Climate change models predict that a "business as usual" approach, that is, no effort to control CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, will result in a more than 2 degrees C increase in annual average surface temperature by approximately 2034. With atmospheric warming comes increased air pollution. The concept of a "climate gap" in air quality control captures the decreased effectiveness of regulatory policies to reduce pollution with a hotter climate. Sources of greenhouse gases and climate-forcing aerosols ("black carbon") are the same sources of air pollutants that harm health. California has adopted robust climate change mitigation policies that are also designed to achieve public health cobenefits by improving air quality. These policies include advanced clean car standards, renewable energy, a sustainable communities strategy to limit suburban sprawl, a low carbon fuel standard, and energy efficiency. A market-based mechanism to put a price on CO2 emissions is the cap-and-trade program that allows capped facilities to trade state-issued greenhouse gas emissions allowances. The "cap" limits total greenhouse gas emissions from all covered sources, and declines over time to progressively reduce emissions. An alternative approach is a carbon tax. California's leadership on air quality and climate change mitigation is increasingly important, given the efforts to slow or even reverse implementation of such policies at the U.S. national level.					60th Annual Thomas L.

The state of the art highlights that the most efficient passive solution for indoor temperature stabilization and control is the integration of thermal mass with an optimized ventilative cooling profile to enhance the thermal cycle of heat storage. Due to its cyclical behavior, thermal mass effects are difficult to predict and quantify with the traditional steady-state approach to building thermal performance. Dynamic thermal simulations help to assess a building's behavior under transient situations, including the thermal mass influence. However, building codes usually include thermal simulations based on standard assumptions: typical meteorological year (TMY), standard occupancy, standard daily-based lighting and appliances profiles, and standard weekly-based occupancy. Thus, when assumptions change, the actual behavior of the building may vary consistently from the predicted conditions. In this paper, we focused on the ability of thermal mass to contrast the influence of variations from the standard assumptions, especially in relation to climate and ventilation profiles. The results show the necessity of encompassing different risk scenarios when evaluating a free cooling solution performance. Among the different scenarios simulated, natural ventilation misuse shows greater influence on the thermal indoor environment, especially if coupled with low thermal mass.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	4	2075-5309			WOS:000430894400001		J	Hooper, Tara; Austen, Melanie C.; Beaumont, Nicola; Heptonstall, Philip; Holland, Robert A.; Ketsopoulou, Ioanna; Taylor, Gail; Watson, Jim; Winskel, Mark				Holland, Robert Alan/C-1928-2012	Holland, Robert Alan/0000-0002-3038-9227; Taylor, Gail/0000-0001-8470-6390			Do energy scenarios pay sufficient attention to the environment?

We suggest that efforts to develop more holistic energy pathways, going beyond post hoc analysis of environmental and social implications, can usefully draw on environmental scenarios. A detailed content analysis of UK energy and environmental scenarios was therefore undertaken, with energy scenarios selected on the basis that they were recent, had a direct link to energy policy, and covered a range of scenario types. The energy scenarios rarely considered societal drivers beyond decarbonisation and focused on quantifiable parameters such as GDP, while the environmental scenarios provided a richer narrative on human behaviour and social change. As socio-economic issues remain fundamental to the success of energy policies, this is a key area which should be better addressed within energy scenarios. The environmental impacts of energy scenarios were rarely considered, but could have a significant bearing on the likelihood of pathway outcomes being realised. Fuller evaluation of the environmental interactions of energy systems is therefore required. Although the analysis focuses on the UK, some international scenarios show similar limitations, suggesting that the conclusions are more widely applicable.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	4	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000428099800039		J	Recka, Lukas; Scasny, Milan				Recka, Lukas/C-3456-2013; Scasny, Milan/F-7394-2012	Recka, Lukas/0000-0003-3115-5884; Scasny, Milan/0000-0001-5040-1281			Brown coal and nuclear energy deployment: Effects on fuel-mix, carbon targets, and external costs in the Czech Republic up to 2050								FUEL				216				494	502		10.1016/j.fuel.2017.12.034				MAR 15 2018	2018	In response to massive destruction of the landscape and significant air pollution due to brown coal mining and usage, in 1991 the Czech Government set territorial limits for brown coal mining in the North Bohemia coal basin (the 'Territorial Environmental Limits'). In 2015, however, this 24-year-old prohibition was lifted at one of two open pit mines under the ban and, as a consequence, some of its reserves of brown coal may be mined in future. We use the regional technology-rich energy system optimization model, TIMES, to analyse the impacts of maintaining the ban versus three options for less environmentally stringent mining policies - the policy adopted in 2015 and two additional policy propositions which would further lift the ban at the second open pit mine, which have not been rejected by the Czech government. We evaluate the effects of these four policy options on the Czech energy system, the costs of generating energy, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and related external environmental and health costs up to 2050. We find that none of the three new policy variants jeopardizes achievement of the 2030 carbon reduction targets. However, the 2050 80% carbon reduction target may not be achievable in any case - the projected reductions range between 66 and 71%, and only maintaining the 1991 ban could reduce this gap, whereas the two policies under discussion would mean that reaching this target would be even more challenging. The newly adopted 2015 policy will lead to at least 709 PJ more brown coal use and up to 85 Mt more greenhouse gases emissions by 2050. The additional supply of brown coal made available by lifting the limits will exceed domestic demand. Brown coal that will be burnt in domestic power plants will lead to additional external costs due to adverse impacts on the environment and human health of up to (sic)306 million.

Treating urban wastewaters, such as greywater and hydroponic wastewater, may represent a strategic point for the implementation of urban farming, ensuring food security, reducing pressures on water resources and promoting climate change mitigation. The WETWALL design concept proposes a unique ecotechnology for secondary wastewater treatment at an urban scale, which brings the novelty of a modular living wall hybrid flow. This concept is based on the integration of two established nature-based solutions/ecomimetic designs: constructed wetlands and a modular living walls. First presented is an overview about the state of the art in the scope of living walls treating wastewater, in order to identify the main design aspects related to the performance of such systems, which mainly concerns the removal of nitrates and phosphates. Second, the WETWALL design concept is presented. A scheme regarding the selection of the main components, such as plants and substrate, is proposed, and potential structure developments and operation strategies are discussed. In addition, considering the scope of integrating the circular economy with the design process, potential interactions between this technology and the urban environment are discussed. The main goal of this article is to substantiate the potential of the WETWALL design concept as an innovative wastewater treatment at an urban scale.									1	0	0	1	0	1	14	25	1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000445122200023		J	Pravalie, Remus; Bandoc, Georgeta								Nuclear energy: Between global electricity demand, worldwide decarbonisation imperativeness, and planetary environmental implications								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				209				81	92		10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.043				MAR 1 2018	2018	For decades, nuclear energy has been considered an important option for ensuring global energy security, and it has recently started being promoted as a solution for climate change mitigation. However, nuclear power remains highly controversial due to its associated risks - nuclear accidents and problematic radioactive waste management. This review aims to assess the viability of global nuclear energy economically (energy-wise), climatically and environmentally. To this end, the nuclear sector's energy and climate-related advantages were explored alongside the downsides that mainly relate to radioactive pollution. Economically, it was found that nuclear energy is still an important power source in many countries around the world. Climatically, nuclear power is a low-carbon technology and can therefore be a viable option for the decarbonization of the world's major economies over the following decades, if coupled with other large-scale strategies such as renewable energies. These benefits are however outweighed by the radioactive danger associated to nuclear power plants, either in the context of the nuclear accidents that have already occurred or in that of the large amounts of long-lived nuclear waste that have been growing for decades and that represent a significant environmental and societal threat.

At present, in Building Regulations and GHG Protocol calculations used for buildings and corporate CO2 emissions calculations, it is standard to use a single number for the CO2 emission factor of each source. This paper considers how energy demand, particularly electricity at different times of the day, season and even year can differ in terms of its CO2 emissions. This paper models three different building types (retail, office and home) using standard software to estimate a profile of energy demand. It then considers how CO2 emissions calculations differ between using the single standard emissions factor and using an hourly emissions factor based on real electrical grid generation over a year. The paper also examines the impact of considering lifetime emissions factors rather than one-year factors using UK government projections. The results show that there is a significant difference to the analysis of benefit in terms of CO2 emissions from different measures - both intra- and inter-year - due to the varying CO2 emissions intensity, even when they deliver the same amount of net energy saving. Other factors not considered in this paper, such as impact on peak generation and air quality, are likely to be important when considering whole-system impacts. In line with this, it is recommended that moves are made to incorporate intra- and inter-year emissions factor changes in methodologies for calculating CO2 emissions. (This is particularly important as demand side response and energy storage, although generally accepted as important in the decarbonisation of the energy system at present will show as an increase in CO2 emissions when using a single number.) Further work quantifying the impact on air quality and peak generation capacity should also be considered. Practical application: This paper aims to help practitioners to understand the performance gap between how systems need to be designed in order to meet regulations compared to how buildings perform in reality - both today and in the future. In particular, it considers the use of real-time' carbon factors in order to attain long-term CO2 reductions. This methodology enables decision makers to understand the impacts of different energy reduction technologies, considering each of their unique characteristics and usage profiles. If implemented, the result is a simple-to-use dataset which can be embedded into the software packages already available onto the market which mirrors the complexity of the electricity grid that is under-represented through the use of a static carbon figure.

These challenges exemplify dietary inequalities an issue countries have committed to ending in accord with the Sustainable Development Goals (by 2030). Achieving this will require a convergence of global diets towards healthy, sustainable guidelines. Here we have assessed the implications of dietary guidelines (the World Health Organization, USA, Australian, Canadian, German Chinese and Indian recommendations) on global greenhouse gas emissions. Our results show a wide disparity in the emissions intensity of recommended healthy diets, ranging from 687 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) capita(-1) yr(-1) for the guideline Indian diet to the 1579 kg CO(2)e capita(-1) yr(-1) in the USA. Most of this variability is introduced in recommended dairy intake. Global convergence towards the recommended USA or Australian diet would result in increased greenhouse gas emissions relative to the average business-as-usual diet in 2050. The majority of current national guidelines are highly inconsistent with a 1.5 degrees C target, and incompatible with a 2 degrees C budget unless other sectors reach almost total decarbonisation by 2050. Effective decarbonisation will require a major shift in not only dietary preferences, but also a reframing of the recommendations which underpin this transition.									19	0	0	6	0	19	14	52	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000429509100006		J	Cassen, Christophe; Hamdi-Cherif, Meriem; Cotella, Giancarlo; Toniolo, Jacopo; Lombardi, Patrizia; Hourcade, Jean-Charles					COTELLA, Giancarlo/0000-0001-8445-412X; LOMBARDI, PATRIZIA/0000-0001-9648-6946			Low Carbon Scenarios for Europe: An Evaluation of Upscaling Low Carbon Experiments								SUSTAINABILITY				10	3					848	10.3390/su10030848				MAR 2018	2018	This paper focuses on transformational processes in a post Paris agreement context. It uses IMACLIM-R, an E3 (Environment-Energy-Economy) model allowing for the integration of urban forms, transport dynamics, environmental policies and behaviors. Building upon the study of a set of local low carbon experiments throughout the European Union (EU), the paper explores two contrasted stylized scenarios of the low carbon transition in Europe. It highlights that carbon pricing policies are useful guides for transition but cannot achieve the ambitious objective without significant transition costs. It shows that low carbon experiments in the transport and energy sectors are critical dimensions of complementary measures in favor of green infrastructures. Broadening and upscaling low carbon experiments helps overcome the inertias of the transport sector by fostering radical changes in infrastructures, thereby introducing deep transformations in mobility behavior. This can then generate positive macroeconomic outcomes, even though they are also dependent on specific financial support, calling for a renegotiation of the social contract based on specific fiscal reforms and measures to secure funding for these initiatives. The paper concludes with some research avenues for improving this preliminary work and calls for a better understanding of the complexity of the socio-economic patterns of both the transition and the conditions for an effective implementation.									1	0	0	0	0	1	2	10	2071-1050			WOS:000428567100275		J	Haslam, Colin; Tsitsianis, Nick; Lehman, Glen; Andersson, Tord; Malamatenios, John								Accounting for decarbonisation and reducing capital at risk in the S&P500								ACCOUNTING FORUM				42	1			119	129		10.1016/j.accfor.2018.01.004				MAR 2018	2018	This article accounts for carbon emissions in the S&P 500 and explores the extent to which capital is at risk from decarbonising value chains.

We find that electricity sector decarbonisation results in co-benefits for water resources primarily due to the phase-out of water-intensive coal-based thermoelectric power generation, although these co-benefits vary substantially across decarbonisation scenarios. Wind and solar photovoltaic power represent a win-win option for both climate and water resources, but further expansion of nuclear or fossil- and biomass-fuelled power plants with carbon capture and storage may result in increased pressures on the water environment. Further to these results, the paper provides insights on the most crucial factors of uncertainty with regards to future estimates of water demand. These estimates varied substantially across models in scenarios where the effects of decarbonisation on the electricity mix were less clear-cut. Future thermal and water efficiency improvements of power generation technologies and demand-side energy efficiency improvements were also identified to be important factors of uncertainty. We conclude that in order to ensure positive effects of decarbonisation on water resources, climate policy should be combined with technology-specific energy and/or water policies.									3	0	0	1	0	3	3	8	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000425959700008		J	Ranius, Thomas; Hamalainen, Aino; Egnell, Gustaf; Olsson, Bengt; Eklof, Karin; Stendahl, Johan; Rudolphi, Jorgen; Stens, Anna; Felton, Adam				; Sjogren, Jorgen/C-9363-2013	Egnell, Gustaf/0000-0001-8744-4613; Ranius, Thomas/0000-0001-7403-3348; Sjogren, Jorgen/0000-0002-0538-8265			The effects of logging residue extraction for energy on ecosystem services and biodiversity: A synthesis								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				209				409	425		10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.048				MAR 1 2018	2018	We review the consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services from the industrial-scale extraction of logging residues (tops, branches and stumps from harvested trees and small-diameter trees from thinnings) in managed forests. Logging residue extraction can replace fossil fuels, and thus contribute to climate change mitigation. The additional biomass and nutrients removed, and soils and other structures disturbed, have several potential environmental impacts. To evaluate potential impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity we reviewed 279 scientific papers that compared logging residue extraction with non-extraction, the majority of which were conducted in Northern Europe and North America. The weight of available evidence indicates that logging residue extraction can have significant negative effects on biodiversity, especially for species naturally adapted to sun-exposed conditions and the large amounts of dead wood that are created by large-scaled forest disturbances. Slash extraction may also pose risks for future biomass production itself, due to the associated loss of nutrients. For water quality, reindeer herding, mammalian game species, berries, and natural heritage the results were complicated by primarily negative but some positive effects, while for recreation and pest control positive effects were more consistent. Further, there are initial negative effects on carbon storage, but these effects are transient and carbon stocks are mostly restored over decadal time perspectives. We summarize ways of decreasing some of the negative effects of logging residue extraction on specific ecosystem services, by changing the categories of residue extracted, and site or forest type targeted for extraction. However, we found that suggested pathways for minimizing adverse outcomes were often in conflict among the ecosystem services assessed. Compensatory measures for logging residue extraction may also be used (e.g. ash recycling, liming, fertilization), though these may also be associated with adverse environmental impacts.

As evidence of their value, a United Nations program exists (http://data. unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7) to try and assess their distribution and there has been a call from 122 scientists across 28 countries for more work to manage, protect and monitor seagrass meadows (http://www. bbc.com/news/science-environment-37606827) . Emerging from the 12th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, held in October 2016, has been the view that grazing marine megafauna may play a useful role in helping to identify previously unknown seagrass habitats. Here we describe this concept, showing how detailed information on the distribution of both dugongs (Dugong dugon) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) obtained, for example, by aerial surveys and satellite tracking, can reveal new information on the location of seagrass meadows. We show examples of how marine megaherbivores have been effective habitat indicators, revealing major, new, deep-water seagrass meadows and offering the potential for more informed estimates of seagrass extent in tropical and sub-tropical regions where current information is often lacking.									3	0	0	3	0	3	3	6		2296-7745		WOS:000456918500001		J	Duenas, Pablo; Ramos, Andres; Tapia-Ahumada, Karen; Olmos, Luis; Rivier, Michel; Perez-Arriaga, Jose-Ignacio				Ramos, Andres/A-6631-2014	Ramos, Andres/0000-0002-8871-1872; Perez-Arriaga, Ignacio/0000-0002-1466-8613			Security of supply in a carbon-free electric power system: The case of Iceland								APPLIED ENERGY				212				443	454		10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.028				FEB 15 2018	2018	Security of supply and progressively climate change are guiding countries' energy policy worldwide. Iceland is a paradigmatic example of gaining energy independence and decarbonizing the power sector while meeting its growing demand. In this paper, we focus on some of the main generation and transmission expansion alternatives that the country is considering for the next decade in an environment dominated by an increasing demand and a generation mix with virtually zero variable cost. We assess the medium- to long-term dimensions of security of supply as determinants of the system configuration and resources utilization. Based on a stochastic hydrothermal scheduling model that includes DC power flows and generation expansion decisions, our analysis indicates that hydro, geothermal and wind renewable resources are more competitive than fossil fuels, while demand flexibility can also contribute to gain security of supply at comparable costs. In addition, our methodology incorporates a detailed bilateral contracting structure typically used by Icelandic generators and consumers to agree on power prices and negotiated curtailments. The modeling and security evaluation could be of interest in other countries and regions where inflexible thermal generation and hydro resources create a market characterized by prices that are close to zero during long periods, but spike when resources are scarce.									3	0	0	0	0	3	2	17	0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000425200700032		J	Qaroush, Abdussalam K.; Alshamaly, Hiba S.; Alazzeh, Shrouq S.; Abeskhron, Ream H.; Assaf, Khaleel I.; Eftaiha, Ala'a F.

Exploiting bio-renewables, viz., inedible saccharides, to reduce the anthropogenic carbon footprint upon providing a sustainable and promising technology that is of interest to different groups of scientists, to overcome demerits associated with the current state-of-the-art aqueous amine scrubbing agents, following a "green chemistry guideline", by employing materials with properties relevant to the environment toward sustainable development. The interdisciplinary nature of research in this area provides a large body of literature that would meet the interest of the broad readership of different multidisciplinary fields. Although many reports emphasize the use of biomass in various industrial products ranging from pharmaceutics, medical preparations, soaps, textiles, cosmetics, household cleaners, and so on, to our knowledge there is no focused article that addresses the application of saccharides for CO2 sequestration. In this review, we highlight the recent advances on the use of oligo-, poly-and cyclic saccharides to achieve a reversible binding of CO2. The future research directions are discussed to provide insight toward achieving sustainable development through implementing bio-renewables.									7	0	0	0	0	7	8	45	2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000424010600001	29675154	J	Davidson, Debra J.; Stedman, Richard C.

Avoiding the catastrophic effects of dangerous climate change will require substantial change, yet emissions continue to rise. Social scientific research on climate change mitigation is dominated by a relatively small number of macro-theoretical frameworks, plus a rather large and disparate empirical literature on individual cognitions, attitudes and behaviors. We apply Archer's reflexivity theory to a survey sample drawn from Alberta, Canada, showing that unique predispositions toward reflexivity offer strong predictors of willingness to engage in climate-related mitigative behaviors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	26	0001-6993	1502-3869		WOS:000418949400005		J	Li, Peilin; Zhao, Pengjun; Brand, Christian					Brand, Christian/0000-0002-1535-5328			Future energy use and CO2 emissions of urban passenger transport in China: A travel behavior and urban form based approach								APPLIED ENERGY				211				820	842		10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.11.022				FEB 1 2018	2018	Work on comparing cities in terms of their transport energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the urban passenger transport sector has rarely been done using detailed travel activity data that takes into account city level differences in terms of economic development, population, and urban form. A personal activity based approach is necessary to better reflect travel behavior change results from different social, economic, urban form, technical, and transportation policy situations in the future. The present study extends the existing activity, modal share, energy intensity, fuel/carbon intensity (ASIF) modeling framework by disaggregating travel activity into key structural components and city-specific factois for 288 prefectural level cities in China. Testable econometric modeling systems were built to link mode split and mode specific travel distances with local economic and urban form characteristics in four different population sizes and two urban form types, based on 187 travel surveys in 108 Chinese cities in the past two decades. Scenarios of energy use and carbon emissions between 2010 (baseline) and 2050 were developed. Results showed that in 2010 urban passenger road transport in China generated 396 Mt CO2 emissions and per capita urban passenger transport energy use increased as city size expanded. By 2030, under business as usual scenario assumptions, energy use in the urban passenger transport sector comprised 23.2 Mt of gasoline, 1.72 Mt of diesel, 3.36 billion M-3 of natural gas, and 0.62 billion kWh of electricity. While national policies targeting travel behavior change have been shown to mitigate emissions to some extent, urban transport policies targeted at specific spatial and temporal drivers of energy demand and emissions may be more effective in meeting policy goals. Short-term policies that promote car-pooling and ride sharing and medium-term policies that increase the cost of driving and promote public transport (such as transit oriented development, walkable neighborhood design, and parking pricing/restraint in city centers) help stabilize carbon emissions over the long term. However, the decision of building polycentric cities might have less significant impact on mitigating urban passenger transport in big cities. Moreover, large-scale promotion of electric vehicles should be designed from a long-term perspective rather than from a short-term one to achieve balanced carbon emissions in regard to the decarbonization process of electricity generation in China.									12	0	0	1	0	12	16	89	0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000425075600065		J	Rosenthal, Joshua; Quinn, Ashlinn; Grieshop, Andrew P.; Pillarisetti, Ajay; Glass, Roger I.

Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) fromsolid fuel combustion is responsible for 3-4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and GlobalWarming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.

To assess the sustainability performance of sugarcane biofuel production in Brazil, we utilised an extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) matrix to determine the multipliers of carbon emissions, primary energy use, labour, imports and economic stimulus, and their relationship to the Brazilian economic system. Furthermore, we performed a hybrid input-output (IO) life cycle assessment to analyse the triple bottom line (TBL) aspects of sugarcane production in Sao Paulo state. In particular, we appraised differences between land used for sugarcane or pasture, and between two distinct sugarcane production systems: 1) in which a mill purchases or rents an area and employs its own labourers and machinery (so-called owners), and 2) in which sugarcane is produced and directly sold by farmers to a mill (so-called suppliers). Our results suggest that if areas that were initially used as pasture for cattle are replaced to sugarcane production, energy consumption is increased by a factor of 3.7, employment is reduced by a factor of 5.4 and GHG emissions are reduced to only 2% for every monetary unit (R$) produced. Our assessments concerning Supplier-and Owner-sugarcane producers demonstrate that the total amount of imports required for both scenarios is similar. The owner scenario results in more direct full-time jobs in comparison to the Supplier scenario. For both scenarios, most of the employment is generated by the upstream sectors of their supply chains. Sugarcane production by suppliers uses less energy and produces less GHG emissions than sugarcane produced by owners.									2	1	0	0	0	3	1	19	1364-0321			WOS:000417079400050		J	Echeverri, Luis Gomez								Investing for rapid decarbonization in cities								CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY				30				42	51		10.1016/j.cosust.2018.02.010				FEB 2018	2018	Cities offer some of the best opportunities for decarbonization. And a few sectors such as buildings, transport, water, and waste have the greatest potential for high impact decarbonization investments. Creating an enabling environment for cities to invest heavily to achieve systemic transformations in these sectors is essential for meeting the less than 2 degrees C target of the Paris Agreement in view of an urban population growing by approximately 1.4 million weekly. Unfortunately, significant barriers exist for these investments to grow at the required pace. The good news is that there are many initiatives such as the alliance of cities that have committed to achieving 80 percent reductions of GHG emissions by 2050, networks such as the C 40 network of city mayors from around the world that connect leaders and undertake research and programs to help cities implement low carbon and climate resilience strategies, and those of major private and institutional investors committed to ramp up their low carbon investments. Furthermore some 110 Paris Agreement country commitments include actions in cities with a focus exactly on those sectors with the greatest potential for decarbonization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000444521500007		J	JacobPark								Information and communication technology in shaping urban low carbon development pathways								CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY				30				133	137		10.1016/j.cosust.2018.05.015				FEB 2018	2018	This article examines the emerging nexus of cities, climate change, and information and communication technologies (ICTs) and highlights the importance of ICT innovation-based urban low carbon development pathways in realizing the 1.5 Celsius (C) climate change global policy objective. The first part of the article reviews the three phases of the scientific scholarship on ICTs, climate change, and environmental sustainability, while the second part of the article examines ICTs in accelerating urban climate change mitigation toward the goal of a 1.5C world. The third part of the article highlights three lessons learned in terms of accelerating ICT innovation-based urban low carbon development pathways to achieve the 1.5C policy priority. First, ICT-based technology innovation with a net positive sustainability impact requires smart policy design and co-innovation of complementary sustainable (e.g. energy efficient, etc.) technologies. Second, ICT innovation-based low carbon pathways need both 'hard' infrastructural (i.e. urban transport, buildings, and other physical, built environment) as well as 'soft' infrastructural (i.e. urban norms, habits, and behavioral framing) dimensions to realize urban system impacts. Third, ICT innovation-based low carbon pathways need to be more effectively designed and reconfigured with 1.5C as their primary objective with a special focus on urban climate change resilience in the developing world. Otherwise, global socio-economic, environmental, and technology inequalities are likely to worsen.									2	0	0	0	0	2	3	9	1877-3435	1877-3443		WOS:000444521500017		J	Holmgren, Mattias; Soerqvist, Patrik								Are Mental Biases Responsible for the Perceived Comfort Advantage in "Green" Buildings?								BUILDINGS				8	2					20	10.3390/buildings8020020				FEB 2018	2018	Previous research has shown that merely calling an indoor environment environmentally certified will make people favor that environment over a conventional alternative. In this paper we explore whether this effect depends on participants deliberately comparing the two environments, and whether different reasons behind the certification influence the magnitude of the effect. In Experiment 1, participants in a between-subjects design assigned higher comfort ratings to an indoor environment that had been labeled environmentally certified in comparison with the exact same indoor environment that was unlabeled, suggesting that the effect arises even when participants do not compare the two environments when making their estimates. The results from Experiment 2 indicate that climate change mitigation (as the reason for the certification) is a slightly better trigger of the effect compared to climate change adaptation. The results suggest that studies on psychological effects of green buildings should experimentally control for the influence from participants' judgmental biases.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	6	2075-5309			WOS:000427510600008		J	Morita, Kanako; Matsumoto, Ken'ichi								REDD+ Financing to Enhance Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation and Biodiversity Co-benefits: Lessons from the Global Environment Facility								AGRIVITA				40	1			118	130		10.17503/agrivita.v40i0.1729				FEB 2018	2018	This study explores ways to effectively and efficiently finance Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities to enhance climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation by drawing on lessons from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The study analyzed trends in the focal areas of GEF forest-related projects, the executing and implementing agencies involved in GEF forest-related multi-focal area projects, and the co-fundraisers' trends in GEF forest-related multi-focal area projects. The analysis of GEF forest-related projects identified ways to finance REDD+ mobilization and distribution to enhance its multiple benefits. The key agencies that support REDD+ activities and enhance these co-benefits are the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and the national governments of developing countries. GEF and the co-fundraisers-multilateral aid agencies, such as UNDP, the World Bank, FAO, the Asian Development Bank, and UNEP, bilateral aid agencies, such as Germany, the United States and the European Union, the private sector and non-governmental organizations-all work to enhance REDD+ co-benefits. Because private contributions to the GEF are limited, it is important to design a scheme to mobilize more private financing for REDD+.									2	0	0	0	0	2	2	12	0126-0537			WOS:000425246100014		J	Bosshart, Nicholas W.; Azzolina, Nicholas A.; Ayash, Scott C.; Peck, Wesley D.; Gorecki, Charles D.; Ge, Jun; Jiang, Tao; Dotzenrod, Neil W.

This work assesses CO2 storage rates and efficiency of saline formations classified by interpreted depositional environment at the regional scale over a 100-year time frame. The focus of this study was placed on developing results applicable to future commercial-scale CO2 storage operations in which an array of injection wells would be used to optimize storage in saline formations. The results of this work suggest future investigations of prospective storage resource in closed or semiclosed formations that may focus less heavily on interpretation of depositional processes. However, the results illustrate the relative importance of depositional environment, aquifer depth, structural geometry, and boundary conditions on the rate of CO2 storage in closed or semiclosed systems.									4	1	0	0	0	5	0	11	1750-5836	1878-0148		WOS:000425112900002		J	West, Thales A.

It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To enhance the co-benefits of forest conservation, it is important to promote synergies among the three measures mitigation, adaptation, and biodiversity/ecosystem conservation in the forest sector and eliminate the overlaps among the three measures. However, limited research exists on the analysis of their synergies. This study explores the potential for synergy among the three forest sector measures, utilizing: 1) indicators that assess enabling conditions for synergies among the three measures at the different institutional levels of policies and strategies, institutional arrangements, and financing and programs/projects; and 2) case studies of five countries in Southeast Asia: Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia.This analysis shows that the five countries all require various changes at different institutional levels in order to enhance their synergy potentials. The findings indicate the importance of national actors, financial mechanisms, programs, and projects in addressing the three measures. In terms of national actors, Thailand has the highest synergy potential due to its national-level committees and a single ministry that addresses all three measures. To enhance their synergy potentials, the other countries need to create national-level committees that address the three measures, and/or they need to enhance collaboration between the various ministries that represent the environment and forestry issues. At the financing and program/project aspects, Vietnam has the highest synergy potential. The other four countries need to develop common national funds that finance the three measures and/or develop joint programs and projects that address the three measures simultaneously.									3	0	0	1	0	3	2	17	1389-9341	1872-7050		WOS:000423640000006		J	Fernandez-Getino, A.

It is essential to study, propose and implement agricultural practices to protect the environment and increase crop yields, whilst at the same time aiming to reduce agricultural emissions and increase C sequestration. Further study of these aspects is important in order to identify the best land management practices and policies to protect the environment. So with this objective in mind, the study of connectivity is an opportunity to gain insight into the sustainability of agroecosystems, due to the close relationship among connectivity, biodiversity and C storage. In fact, high connectivity values can be associated with healthy ecosystems and high levels of biodiversity, which can assure better soil protection and can favor sustainability, implying a greater soil C sequestration capacity.The measure of connectivity's temporal variation using analysis of current connectivity (inter- and intra-compartments) and the development of risk and vulnerability maps are key facts to, on one side, identify areas most prone to habitat degradation and fragmentation, and then, on another side to establish priorities. This proposed analysis must be carried out by sectors and in a stratified way. For it, "Sector agricultural connectivity units" are proposed as a dimensionless measuring concept to implement this assessment.To establish agricultural land management schemes and programs for policy intervention at European level in order to guide the strategy to address environmental issues in the agricultural sector, we propose a set of lines of action focused mainly on three aspects: the development of National Action Plans, the establishment of Monitoring Programs, and the integration of their outcomes with the information from available databases through Big Data treatments and other analysis tools. Furthermore, to achieve this goal, the role of farmers can not be underestimated and the communication problems between farmers and scientists should be solved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	5	18	0264-8377	1873-5754		WOS:000423643400013		J	Tattini, Jacopo; Gargiulo, Maurizio; Karlsson, Kenneth				Gargiulo, Maurizio/V-2964-2019	Gargiulo, Maurizio/0000-0001-7735-6441; Tattini, Jacopo/0000-0001-5751-2048; Karlsson, Kenneth Bernard/0000-0001-7749-254X			Reaching carbon neutral transport sector in Denmark - Evidence from the incorporation of modal shift into the TIMES energy system modeling framework								ENERGY POLICY				113				571	583		10.1016/j.enpol.2017.11.013				FEB 2018	2018	Energy/Economy/Environment/Engineering (E4) models have been rarely apt to represent human behaviour in transportation mode adoption. This paper contributes to the scientific literature by using an E4 model to analyse the long-term decarbonisation of the Danish transport sector. The study is carried out with TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model of Denmark, which has been expanded in order to endogenously determine modal shares. The methodology extends the technology competition within the modes to competition across modes by aggregating the passenger modal travel demands into demand segments based on the distance range. Modal shift is based not only on the levelised costs of the modes, but also on speed and infrastructure requirement. Constraints derived from the National Travel Survey guarantee consistent travel habits and avoid unrealistic modal shifts. The comparison of model versions with and without modal shift identifies its positive contribution to the fulfilment of the Danish environmental targets. Four sensitivity analyses on the key variables of modal shift assess how their alternative realizations affect the decarbonisation of the transport sector and enable shifting away from car. The results indicate that less strict travel time budget (1113) and increased speed of public bus lead to a more efficient decarbonisation by 2050.									11	0	0	0	0	11	3	6	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000423009500054		J	Bhagat, C.; Dudhagara, P.; Tank, S.

Among the various GHGs, carbon dioxide occupies the first position in the anthroposphere and has detrimental effects on the ecosystem. For decarbonization, several non-biological methods of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) have been in use for the past few decades, but they are suffering from narrow applicability. Recently, CO2 emission and its disposal related problems have encouraged the implementation of bioprocessing to achieve a zero waste economy for a sustainable environment. Microbial carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyses reversible CO2 hydration and forms metal carbonates that mimic the natural phenomenon of weathering/carbonation and is gaining merit for CCUS. Thus, the diversity and specificity of CAs from different micro-organisms could be explored for CCUS. In the literature, more than 50 different microbial CAs have been explored for mineral carbonation. Further, microbial CAs can be engineered for the mineral carbonation process to develop new technology. CA driven carbonation is encouraging due to its large storage capacity and favourable chemistry, allowing site-specific sequestration and reusable product formation for other industries. Moreover, carbonation based CCUS holds five-fold more sequestration capacity over the next 100years. Thus, it is an eco-friendly, feasible, viable option and believed to be the impending technology for CCUS. Here, we attempt to examine the distribution of various types of microbial CAs with their potential applications and future direction for carbon capture. Although there are few key challenges in bio-based technology, they need to be addressed in order to commercialize the technology.									6	0	0	2	0	6	4	30	1364-5072	1365-2672		WOS:000422980800001	28921830	J	Yadav, S.

The geographic coverage of the literature is global but with specific examples from India. The information presented in this paper is derived from diverse sources including journal articles and thematic books, and indicates severe adverse impacts not only on women's livelihood opportunities but also on exacerbating the workload and fatigue while decreasing their self esteem and forcing them to undertake some high risks and hazardous activities. The literature indicates that poverty, gender inequality, insecure land rights, heavy reliance on agriculture, less access to education and information are among the principal reasons for their vulnerability to climate change. The vulnerability is also confounded by the meager asset base, social marginalization, lack of mobility and exclusion from the decision-making processes in response to a disaster. However, the literature also shows that women are not only the passive victims of climate change but are also pro-active and agents of hope for adaptation to and mitigation of abrupt climate change. They utilize their experience and expertise to reduce the adverse impacts by adopting prudent strategies. They are also concerned about environmental issues, and are highly supportive of policies regarding environmental restoration. Large knowledge gaps exist regarding the vulnerability of women to changing and uncertain climate especially in arid regions. Authors of this article suggest some action plans and strategies to minimize vulnerability to climate change such as empowering women economically and educationally, organizing training and outreach programmes, and involving them in formal climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes. Authors also outline research needed in order to identify and implement strategies regarding climate change. Collective and continuous efforts are critical to finding the sustainable solutions for this global phenomenon which is adversely impacting the most vulnerable but critically important members of the society.

The research examines the influence of installer businesses on rates of uptake and standards of installation, and the interplay between business practices and the policy environment. The research developed new detailed datasets through a nationwide survey, to which 388 installers responded, and follow-up interviews with 22 installers. Focusing on solar photovoltaics and air source heat pumps installed in households, the results show the fundamental dependence of installer businesses on government financial incentives and on the quality assurance scheme in operation. Market confidence was compromised by the sharp reduction in the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) for residential solar PV in 2012 and long delays to the equivalent Renewable Heat Incentive for residential installations. Nevertheless, more modest FIT levels have reduced the risk of sub-optimal installations and inappropriate specification of microgeneration systems. The findings underline the need for consistent policy to allow installer businesses and their supply chains to develop and mature, and thus facilitate commercial deployment of microgeneration of high quality, raise its competiveness with incumbent forms of energy supply and contribute to decarbonisation goals.

However, this region is also under pressure to protect its environment, keep its development sustainable and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, accurately estimating the temporal and spatial dynamics of CO2 emissions and analysing the factors influencing these emissions are especially important. This paper estimates the CO2 emissions derived from the fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes of 18 central cities in China between 2000 and 2014. The results indicate that these 18 cities, which contain an average of 6.57% of the population and 7.91% of the GDP, contribute 13% of China's total CO2 emissions. The highest cumulative CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2014 were from Taiyuan and Wuhan, with values of 2268.57 and 1847.59 million tons, accounting for 19.21% and 15.64% of the total among these cities, respectively. Therefore, the CO2 emissions in the Taiyuan urban agglomeration and Wuhan urban agglomeration represented 28.53% and 20.14% of the total CO2 emissions from the 18 cities, respectively. The three cities in the Zhongyuan urban agglomeration also accounted for a second highest proportion of emissions at 23.51%. With the proposal and implementation of the Rise of Central China Plan in 2004, the annual average growth rate of total CO2 emissions gradually decreased and was lower in the periods from 2005 to 2010 (5.44%) and 2010 to 2014 (5.61%) compared with the rate prior to 2005 (12.23%). When the 47 socioeconomic sectors were classified into 12 categories, "power generation" contributed the most to the total cumulative CO2 emissions at 36.51%, followed by the "non-metal and metal industry", "petroleum and chemical industry", and "mining" sectors, representing emissions proportions of 29.81%, 14.79%, and 9.62%, respectively. Coal remains the primary fuel in central China, accounting for an average of 80.59% of the total CO2 emissions. Industrial processes also played a critical role in determining the CO2 emissions, with an average value of 7.3%. The average CO2 emissions per capita across the 18 cities increased from 6.14 metric tons in 2000 to 15.87 metric tons in 2014, corresponding to a 158.69% expansion. However, the average CO2 emission intensity decreased from 0.8 metric tons/1000 Yuan in 2000 to 0.52 metric tons/1000 Yuan in 2014 with some fluctuations. The changes in and industry contributions of carbon emissions were city specific, and the effects of population and economic development on CO2 emissions varied. Therefore, long-term climate change mitigation strategies should be adjusted for each city. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is necessary to consider that this technological deployment will constitute only a partial solution for the problem regarding the availability of automotive fuel and its impact on air quality. Suitability of electric powertrain as a substitute for the Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) is not under discussion, nor its main environmental potential benefits (no contribution to pollution, no emissions of particles or nitrogen oxides) at a local level, but the generation of electricity to be stored in the batteries pollutes the environment during its production at power plant level. Global Zero-Emissions (ZE) transport solution goes through supplying electricity using renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar and geothermal), together with a change in social habits. In this paper, the use of electric vehicles and its influence in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) inventories is analyzed. Calculation of the GHG emissions associated to the use of BEVs is put under question, and a new approach for assessing realistic GHG emissions at power plant level puts in evidence the inaccuracy of the existing methods.

Within this context, energy policy-makers face the need to move from economy-to sustainability-oriented schemes. Beyond the integration of the sustainability concept into energy policies through the implementation of techno-economic, environmental and/or social restrictions, other approaches propose the use of externalities-based on life-cycle emissions-to deeply take into account sustainability in the design of the future energy system. In this sense, this work evaluates the consequences of internalising socio-environmental externalities associated with power generation. Besides the calculation of external costs of power generation technologies and their implementation in an energy systems optimisation model for Spain, the life-cycle consequences of this internalisation are explored. This involves the prospective analysis of the evolution of the sustainability indicators on which the externalities are founded, i.e. climate change and human health. For the first time, this is done by endogenously integrating the life-cycle indicators into the energy systems optimisation model. The results show that the internalisation of externalities highly influences the evolution of the electricity production mix as well as the corresponding life-cycle profile, hastening the decarbonisation of the power generation system and thus leading to a significant decrease in life-cycle impacts. This effect is observed both when internalising only climate change externalities and when internalising additionally human health external costs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing the effects of future climate change on urban flood volumes is crucial to informing better management of such disasters given the severity of the devastating impacts of flooding (e.g. the 2016 flooding events across China). Although recent studies have investigated the impacts of future climate change on urban flooding, the effects of both climate change mitigation and adaptation have rarely been accounted for together in a consistent framework. In this study, we assess the benefits of mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and locally adapting to climate change by modifying drainage systems to reduce urban flooding under various climate change scenarios through a case study conducted in northern China. The urban drainage model - Storm Water Management Model was used to simulate urban flood volumes using current and two adapted drainage systems (i.e. pipe enlargement and low-impact development, LID), driven by bias-corrected meteorological forcing from five general circulation models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive. Results indicate that urban flood volume is projected to increase by 52% over 2020-2040 compared to the volume in 1971-2000 under the business-as-usual scenario (i.e. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5). The magnitudes of urban flood volumes are found to increase nonlinearly with changes in precipitation intensity. On average, the projected flood volume under RCP 2.6 is 13% less than that under RCP 8.5, demonstrating the benefits of global-scale climate change mitigation efforts in reducing local urban flood volumes. Comparison of reduced flood volumes between climate change mitigation and local adaptation (by improving drainage systems) scenarios suggests that local adaptation is more effective than climate change mitigation in reducing future flood volumes. This has broad implications for the research community relative to drainage system design and modelling in a changing environment. This study highlights the importance of accounting for local adaptation when coping with future urban floods.									6	2	0	1	0	7	4	28	1027-5606	1607-7938		WOS:000419992900002		S	Caetano, Nidia S.; Carvalho, Rafael R.; Franco, Francisco R.; Afonso, Carlos A.

Considering that man spend a significant part of their lives inside buildings that represent a significant share of energy consumption, buildings turn out to be an attractive area to invest efforts, aiming to improve efficiency, as recommended in the European Commission reports. However, despite the goals outlined in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, there are difficulties in the projection of new buildings that can be classified as nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). These include legal and financial obstacles, as insufficient formation of professionals (such as architects, engineers and consultants) able to tackle the challenges. This paper aims to point strategies that can contribute to the creation of a nearly zero energy laboratory in a university environment, that works as a tool for raising awareness about nZEB while improving the future engineering professionals' skills towards team work and knowledge sharing a living lab.

Pursuant to Directive 2014/94 / EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the development of alternative fuels infrastructure, alternative fuels are fuels or energy sources that serve, at least partially, as a substitute for crude oil sources of energy in transport and which can potentially contribute to the decarbonisation of transport and the improvement of the environmental performance of the transport sector. In this aspect, the analysis of normative documents relevant to the use of alternative fuels in the area of transport was made. Reference was also made to the current state of the alternative fuels market as well as prospects for its development. The problems of environmental pollution by motor vehicles were presented and actions promoting electromobility in selected European countries were pointed out. The last part of the work presents the result of environmental research on the use of alternative fuels in Poland. The forecasts for electric vehicles are presented, taking into account three scenarios of their development and then, with the assumed boundary conditions, the values of pollutant emission limitations from the transport sector were estimated until 2025.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1506-218X			WOS:000469166000049		S	Patel, Anil Kumar						Singhania, RR; Agarwal, RA; Kumar, RP; Sukumaran, RK		Land Applications of Biochar: An Emerging Area								WASTE TO WEALTH		Energy Environment and Sustainability						171	197		10.1007/978-981-10-7431-8_9				2018	2018	In recent years, there has been increasing interest on land application of biochar for improved carbon sequestration, pollutants removal, and soil amelioration. The biomass conversion into biochar and subsequent land application of biochar significantly stabilizes the ecosystem via GHG emission reduction and carbon sequestration, thus leading to the climate change mitigation. Biochar properties (e.g., surface area, microporosity, and pH) significantly improve the soil physiochemical (e.g., water-holding capacity, O-2 content, moisture level, nutrient adsorption/desorption, pollutants immobilization), and biological properties (e.g., microbial abundance and activity) improves the soil health. Current research mainly aims to exploit biochar to recover nutrients from waste matters and utilize the resulting nutrient-enriched biochar as a source of micronutrients especially in nutrient-depleting soils to sustain the crop productivity. This chapter compiles the recent advances of biochar in land application, focusing important physiochemical attributes and mechanisms pertinent to soil amelioration and plant growth promotion. Moreover, biochar application rate and methods of land applications are also outlined.					1st International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Challenges (SEEC)1st International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Challenges (SEEC)	FEB 26-28, 2017FEB 26-28, 2017	Int Soc Energy & Environm Sustainabil; Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioprocessing; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol; TSI; Tesscorn; AVL; Horiba; SpringerInt Soc Energy & Environm Sustainabil; Ctr Innovat & Appl Bioprocessing; Govt India, Dept Sci & Technol; TSI; Tesscorn; AVL; Horiba; Springer	Mohali, INDIAMohali, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	2522-8366	2522-8374	978-981-10-7431-8; 978-981-10-7430-1	WOS:000467200200010		B	Muzi, F.; Calcara, L.; Sangiovanni, S.; Pompili, M.

The simulator can be operated in either "Economy" mode to maximize economic profit, or "Energy" mode, for better energy saving.

In many ways, this investment is a typical example of how private interests and capital accumulation are prioritised over local concerns in natural resource management under neoliberalism. This study, however, indicated that investors had genuine intentions of creating mutual benefits for the global environment and local people. Drawing on Li (2007), we show that this will to improve' was nevertheless constructed in ways that resulted in prioritisation of global climate change mitigation over local context-specific concerns.We identify three core factors making the win-win discourse around Kachung plantation especially resilient: (i) the perceived urgency of climate change mitigation, (ii) the apolitical framing of sustainability' as an environmental issue that can be fixed through external technical interventions and (iii) the devaluation of local and context-specific knowledge. We end by suggesting that research on the neoliberalisation of nature focus more on analysing the rationales behind specific interventions. This would leave us better equipped to suggest how such interventions should be modified to produce true wins for local contexts.									4	0	0	0	0	4	1	1	1523-908X	1522-7200		WOS:000430722300005		B	Arora, Mohit; Raspall, Felix; Silva, Arlindo			ASME					IDENTIFYING DESIGN INTERVENTIONS IN CITIES FOR URBAN SUSTAINABILITY								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2018, VOL 4										V004T05A025					2018	2018	Cities have been the focus of recent sustainability and climate change mitigation efforts primarily because of unprecedented urban growth and ever-increasing resources consumption. A worrying trend has been the ever-decreasing life of buildings in cities because of premature building obsolescence. Premature building obsolescence has been cited as the major driver of demolition waste which accounts for more than 40% of total waste generated annually. This waste stream poses a bigger challenge as the pressure on natural resources increases with urban growth. A traditional way of looking at the urban sustainability has been from the perspective of the environmental sciences and waste management methods. Analyzing urban areas with design science perspectives could provide novel insights to improve existing resource consumption patterns and transform sustainability growth in cities. This study focuses on the problem of demolition waste arising from the premature building obsolescence in cities. It applies a design research methodology framework for identifying existing problems associated with demolition waste and generating strategies to transform cities into more sustainable urban systems. In the problem clarification phase, a detailed literature review was supported with stakeholder's interviews to identify the state-of-art for building demolition process and demolition waste. Research was further extended to descriptive study-I phase to carry out a demolition case study and generate support tools to enable transformation in the existing scenario for achieving a desired state. Singapore, a dense city state of South East Asia has been taken as a case study in this research. Results show that applying design research methods could help open-up a new dimension to solve urban sustainability challenge for built environment. It highlights that material reuse could lead to significant improvement in the built environment sustainability but the challenge associated with realization of material reuse practice needs to be addressed. Descriptive study-I concludes with the strategies on creating a reuse market through entrepreneurial innovation and an alternative material supply chain of secondary materials for regional housing demand. These results highlight the role of design research methods for tackling complex systems level problems in cities.

The exponential growth of digital technologies, the increasing impacts of climate change, impending Brexit and looming social and environmental pressures are driving change to the construction industry. Increasingly policies press for the adoption of sustainability and construction organisations are realising that small sustainable impacts are no longer enough. Therefore, measurement is one of the keys to the implementation of sustainable construction strategies. Advances in data gathering, computing power and connectivity mean that construction organisations have more information and data than ever before. Collecting, analysing and understanding those large volumes of available data, known as Big Data, about how an organisation operates sustainably leads to knowledge that can improve decision making, refine goals and focus efforts. However, when it comes to sustainability the great thing about big data is that it is unlocking the ability of businesses to understand and act on what is typically their biggest sustainable (i.e. economic, social and environmental) impacts - the ones outside their control. Measuring and understanding how doing business really does affect the natural world will open new opportunities for bringing sustainability inside an organisation: creating change, cutting costs and boosting long-term profitability in a resource-constrained world. Still, there are issues and challenges around gathering sustainability-related data, as well as in analysing and interpreting of data points. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the barriers to adopting big data related to sustainable strategies.The relationship between Policy Making, Big Data and sustainability is still in early stages, but already several applications can be mention to the environment, health and construction, such as biodiversity loss monitoring, pollution zones Identification, endangered species location, smart energy management, cost reduction or investment assessment. In the same way, barriers and opportunities were identified, for instance: the lack of financial resources and business case, skills and training, unequal opportunity and security and disclosure issues among the barriers, and partnership, emerging and accessible technology, personalization of the environment among the opportunities. Finally, the biggest challenge presented by the implementation of Big Data is concept standardization, since there are many areas in which one way or another is making use of this technology without being recognized as such. In the same way, the greatest asset that represents the use of Big Data for sustainability is the identification of the future causes and consequences of climate change and its subsequent prevention or mitigation in time.					11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC-Companion) / 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC-Companion) / 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT)	DEC 17-20, 2018DEC 17-20, 2018	IEEE; ACM; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; ACM; IEEE Comp Soc	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	5	2373-6860		978-1-7281-0359-4	WOS:000458720100063		S	Roesch, M.; Berger, C.; Braunreuther, S.; Reinhart, G.

Consequently, companies can decrease energy costs by using production control to flexibly reduce energy demand during periods of high energy costs and vice versa. However, such measures influence the general production objectives and can cause follow-up costs, as for example products may not be finished on time if machines are temporarily shut down to achieve lower energy costs. This paper presents an approach for evaluating the impacts of energy-oriented actions within production control using a cost-model.

The article summarizes the literature on estimates of emission reduction potentials attributed to ICIs. This summary highlights three key issues: there is a plethora of uncoordinated initiatives, often lacking specific, time-bound goals; to a greater or lesser extent most initiatives overlap with the activities conducted under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); and few initiatives have set up transparent performance monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The article concludes with two considerations. Firstly, it advocates for the United Nations Environment Programme as one entity that could bring much-needed coordination among ICIs, and between ICIs and national government-led efforts to mitigate climate change. Secondly, it echoes calls for the initiatives to both adopt transparent monitoring, reporting and verification mechanisms, and ensure that their activities are cost-effective with regard to climate change mitigation. Finally, the article outlines the key issues that will need to be addressed to achieve these goals.Key policy insightsThe emission reductions potential of international cooperative initiatives appears to be limited, which would question some of the rational for promoting them.The extent to which international cooperative initiatives overlap with emission reduction efforts under the UNFCCC is uncertain, but believed to be quite large.The UNFCCC is arguably ill suited to coordinate and strengthen the accountability of international cooperative initiatives.									4	0	0	0	0	4	1	7	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000428156600010		J	Woolf, Dominic; Solomon, Dawit; Lehmann, Johannes								Land restoration in food security programmes: synergies with climate change mitigation								CLIMATE POLICY				18	10			1260	1270		10.1080/14693062.2018.1427537				2018	2018	Food-insecure households in many countries depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program-PSNP - which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP's land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 millionMgCO(2)ey(-1) - approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia's Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact.Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration.Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels.Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework.Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment.Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration.									1	0	0	0	0	1	11	22	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000445646500004		J	Goldberg, Jeremy A.; Marshall, Nadine A.; Birtles, Alastair; Case, Peter; Curnock, Matthew I.; Gurney, Georgina G.

Coral reef ecosystems, like the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), are particularly vulnerable to human impacts such as coastal development, resource extraction, and climate change. Resource managers and policymakers along the GBR have consequently initiated a variety of programs to engage local stakeholders and promote conservation activities to protect the environment. However, little is known about how and why stakeholders feel connected to the GBR nor how this connection affects the proenvironmental behaviors they undertake. We present the results of 5891 surveys and show that the attitudes that residents, tourists, and tourism operators have about the GBR are closely tied to the behaviors and activities they take to protect the environment. Our findings suggest that the responsibility, pride, identity, and optimism that people associate with the GBR are significantly correlated to several proenvironmental behaviors, including recycling, participation in conservation groups, and certain climate change mitigation activities. Respondents who feel the strongest connection to the GBR take the most action to protect the environment. Tourism operators who strongly identify with the GBR take more action to protect the environment than those who do not. Encouraging individual identification with the GBR via targeted messages and engagement campaigns may assist not only in GBR conservation, but a wider sustainability movement as well. A better understanding of the individual attitudes and beliefs held by local stakeholders is a key first step toward effective communication to influence conservation activities.									2	0	0	0	0	2	6	13	1708-3087			WOS:000437397400018		J	Lindberg, Fredrik; Grimmond, C.

Urban areas are responsible for the emission of 60% of global greenhouse gas, 50% of which are produced by buildings. During the past decades, increasing urban growth and sprawl processes produced several urban layouts characterized by different morphological features and a common lack of sustainable energy and environmental solutions. Investigating the relationship between urban morphology, energy demand and carbon emission/sequestration represents a relevant topic for urban planning practices implemented to face urban climate change effects. This study proposes a method for a transformability assessment aimed at investigating the transformation suitability of different urban morphology types. The case study is the metropolitan area of Catania (Italy), characterized by an impressive urban growth since the 1960s. The proposed method identification of limits and options for increasing sustainability of urban areas considering the contribution of both NUAs and built-up areas. This approach allows to identify appropriate planning tools for new layouts of urban fabrics while increasing the objectivity of the decision process. In the framework of climate change mitigation and adaptation, the outcomes of this research may lead to innovative urban planning practices.									3	0	0	1	0	3	5	33	0965-4313	1469-5944		WOS:000424993800010		J	Doelman, Jonathan C.; Stehfest, Elke; Tabeau, Andrzej; van Meijl, Hans; Lassaletta, Luis; Gernaat, David E.

Ambitions to limit global warming to 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C could also lead to additional pressures from land-based mitigation measures such as bioenergy production and afforestation. To investigate these dynamics, this paper describes five elaborations of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework to produce regional and gridded scenarios up to the year 2100. Additionally, land-based climate change mitigation is modelled aiming for long-term mitigation targets including 1.5 degrees C. Results show diverging global trends in agricultural land in the baseline scenarios ranging from an expansion of nearly 826 Mha in SSP3 to a decrease of more than 305 Mha in SSP1 for the period 2010-2050. Key drivers are population growth, changes in food consumption, and agricultural efficiency. The largest changes take place in Sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, predominantly due to high population growth. With low increases in agricultural efficiency this leads to expansion of agricultural land and reduced food security. Land use also plays a crucial role in ambitious mitigation scenarios. First, agricultural emissions could form a substantial component of emissions that cannot be fully mitigated. Second, bioenergy and reforestation are crucial to create net negative emissions reducing emissions in SSP2 in 2050 by 8.7 Gt CO2/yr and 1.9 Gt CO2/yr, respectively (1.5 degrees C scenario compared to baseline). This is achieved by expansion of bioenergy area (516 Mha in 2050) and reforestation. Expansion of agriculture for food production is reduced due to REDD policy (290 Mha in 2050) affecting food security especially in Sub-Saharan Africa indicating an important trade-off of land-based mitigation. This set of SSP land-use scenarios provides a comprehensive quantification of interacting trends in the land system, both socio-economic and biophysical. By providing high resolution data, the scenario output can improve interactions between climate research and impact studies.									24	0	0	6	0	24	8	38	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000429399000012		J	Duran, Gracia Marin								SHELTERING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO "GREEN' ELECTRICITY: THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION								INTERNATIONAL & COMPARATIVE LAW QUARTERLY				67	1			129	165		10.1017/S0020589317000537				JAN 2018	2018	Since the Canada - Renewable Energy (2013) dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO), the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) has been the focal point of academic debate on the trade-environment interface, with a growing consensus that WTO subsidy rules need to be revisited with a view to securing policy space' for government support for renewable energy. This article explores whether, as suggested by some scholars, the European Union (EU)'s system of justifications for renewable energy aid could serve as a source of inspiration for the WTO. While this proposition may appear attractive at first sight, it is hardly conceivable, or even desirable, that the EU's approach to sheltering government support for renewable energy could be transposed to the WTO. This is because the two systems of subsidy control are fundamentally different in both substantive and procedural terms and, importantly, these differences reflect distinct objectives and political/institutional contexts. Nonetheless, this comparative analysis sheds light on where the key challenges lie for the WTO in ensuring that international trade rules and climate change mitigation objectives are mutually supportive. It is argued that the case for reviewing the SCM Agreement cannot be made by simply forging parallels with the EU's regulatory model, but needs to be carefully construed on the basis of a proper understanding of whether and how green policy space is actually constrained under the current WTO subsidy and trade remedy rules. However, this requires better information on existing WTO members' practice in relation to renewable energy subsidies, as well as on their environmental effectiveness and possible trade-distortive impact. In this sense, the most valuable lesson that the WTO can draw from the EU's regulatory experience is the imperative of improving the transparency and knowledge-enhancing elements of its subsidy control system.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	9	0020-5893	1471-6895		WOS:000419372500005		S	Musabikha, Siti; Utama, I.

Its development is arising too due to increased interest research topic concerning climate change mitigation. Due to its rotating movement, it will be induced mechanical forces, such as shear stress and/or particle impact. Because of its natural operations, vertical axis turbine is also being exposed to harsh and corroding marine environment itself In order to secure the vertical tidal turbine devices from mechanical wear and corrosion effects which is lead to a material loss, an appropriate erosion-corrosion protection needs to be defined. Its protection actionscan be derived such as design factors, material selections, inhibitors usage, cathodic protections, and coatings.

Natural gas use, particularly for electricity generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal generation. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options, including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) providing essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies including fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of emission reductions.

Drawing from the work of Goran Therborn, this article examines farmers' climate change beliefs, explores emerging contradictions between conservative ideological positions and personal experiences, and looks for signs of ideological transformation. Data from 154 personal interviews with corn farmers in the Midwestern United States reveals that many farmers believe that humans play some role in climate change and that climate change has serious and negative impacts on agriculture. Interview data also illustrates how farmers contradict themselves when discussing their positions on climate change and suggests that farmers may be losing faith in political elites. As farmers continue to experience the impacts of climate change, they may find it increasingly difficult to support conservative positions. However, this study also reveals that, despite individual beliefs, the political economy of industrial agriculture will continue to constrain the adoption of climate change mitigation measures.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	18	0038-0199	1467-9523		WOS:000419937300004		J	Hyun, Koh Moon								Basic Principle of Public Understanding Guideline Concerning CCS			이산화탄소 포집･저장 관련 대중소통 가이드라인의 기본원칙					Public Land Law Review	토지공법연구			84				281	299						2018	2018	Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage(CCS) is a large-scale reducing technique of Greenhouse Gas and major advanced countries such as USA and Canada etc. have made a strategy for commercialization of CCS and practiced it, into the bargain, prepared for legal framework for CCS by making new law or revising existing law on ccs.Considering the fact that Korea needs to prepare a proper legal basis for our situation and that the public understanding of CCS is very low, along with the relevant legal basis for the development of CCS technology and its implementation, In order to promote the CCS project smoothly in terms of climate change and environment, it is necessary to raise awareness among the general public and promote understanding of the environment and how to respond to climate change through active public communication activities. Optimizing the duration of the CCS project through the smooth implementation of the CCS project in terms of economic and social aspects can increase the economics of the project. From a scientific standpoint, a good public understanding of science and technology for responding to climate change could be the basis for public opinion to promote CCS technology development.With this in mind, we also looked at the outline of public understanding toward CCS and the principles of making public understanding in Chapter 2, the basic principles for public understanding in Chapter 3, the major considerations for public understanding and survey on public perception toward CCS in Chapter 4, and drew a conclusion in Chapter 5.

Road freight transport, trucking in particular, has a large share in the energy consumption, CO2-emissions and air pollution by human activities. This will become an even bigger issue with the expected massive growth of road freight transport. Climate change mitigation asks for a major reduction of CO2-emissions from human origin. Improvement of air quality is a second reason why trucking companies have to look for alternative engine-fuel configurations: Biodiesel, gas and electricity. The paper answers two research questions: New truck technologies are under way, what impact could these have on fuel consumption and emissions related with the fuel consumption of trucks? How realistic is large-scale introduction of these new technologies before the year 2030? A model was used to estimate the emissions of CO2, NOx and PM10 of a truck transporting goods along a pre-defined route consisting of city roads and highways. The volumes and composition of the emissions vary depending on the data entered by the user: Route/distance, fuel efficiency/consumption, emission factors and engine-fuel configuration. The model was used for a micro-simulation, but an extension towards a macro-simulation model is feasible. This would allow to estimate the impact on fuel consumption and emissions for a fleet of trucks. The model indicates that the main benefit of an alternative like biodiesel lies in the reduction of PM10-emissions. Electric trucking is necessary to drastically reduce CO2-emissions and air pollution. In a few years from now hybrid diesel-electric trucks will become common. Full-electric trucks energized by internal (hydrogen in fuel cells) and/or external (trolley-like, high density batteries) sources are feasible well before the year 2030. Electric trucking means a drastic change in the use of fuels with implications for the electricity grid as well.					7th International Conference on Energy and Sustainability7th International Conference on Energy and Sustainability	20172017	Wessex Inst; Univ Seville; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Int Journal Energy Prod & ManagementWessex Inst; Univ Seville; WIT Transact Ecol & Environm; Int Journal Energy Prod & Management	Seville, SPAINSeville, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2	1743-3541		978-1-78466-222-6; 978-1-78466-221-9	WOS:000450031900020		S	Gao, Qing; Kang, Rong; Ekeland, Anders; Kovarnik, Jaroslav						Jedlicka, P; Maresova, P; Soukal, I		The Difficulties of Launching and Operating CCUS Projects - Evidence from China								HRADEC ECONOMIC DAYS, PT I, 2018		Hradec Economic Days		8				267	274						2018	2018	Serious environmental problems have resulted in an intense search for technologies to reduce emissions of green gasses in order to stabilize the climate change. CCUS was first proposed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989 as a way of climate change mitigation [9]. Since then, research on CCUS technologies have been rapidly developing and the International Energy Agency (IEA) has pointed CCUS technology one of the key technologies if we are to limit the temperature increase to 2 degrees C by 2050 [1]. However, this technology have been initiated and developed in a complex environment; with micro, macro and meso level barriers entangled, resulting making it difficult to full implementation of CCUS. We are focusing on the difficulties faced by the implementation of CCUS projects in China, since understanding more the difficulties will lead to a more optimal policy portfolio in the future for developing such projects.					16th International Scientific Conference on Hradec Economic Days16th International Scientific Conference on Hradec Economic Days	JAN 30-31, 2018JAN 30-31, 2018	Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept EconUniv Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Econ	Hradec Kralove, CZECH REPUBLICHradec Kralove, CZECH REPUBLIC	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	2464-6059	2464-6067	978-80-7435-700-8	WOS:000449443500026		S	Petri, Ioan; Alhamami, Ali; Rezgui, Yacine; Kubicki, Sylvain				PETRI, IOAN/X-8333-2019	PETRI, IOAN/0000-0002-1625-8247; Kubicki, Sylvain/0000-0003-2985-0378	CamarinhaMatos, LM; Afsarmanesh, H; Rezgui, Y		A Virtual Collaborative Platform to Support Building Information Modeling Implementation for Energy Efficiency								COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS OF COGNITIVE SYSTEMS		IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology		534				539	550		10.1007/978-3-319-99127-6_46				2018	2018	There is increased interest in complying with the new regulations and policies associated with the climate change. In particular industries such as the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry seek to find new strategies and practices for facilitating sustainability but also new regulations to improve efficiency at the building level. Institutions and industrial bodies are now in the process of alignment with new legislative stipulations regarding carbon emissions with wider reflection into environment, social and economic models. At building level such strategies refer to decarbonisation and energy efficiency supported with data driven techniques enriched with virtual collaboration and optimization methods.The increased interest of the research community in Building Information Modeling (BIM) has facilitated numerous solutions ranging from digital products, information retrieval, and optimization techniques all aiming at addressing energy optimization and performance gap reduction.In this paper we present how a virtual collaborative system can be efficiently used for implementing BIM based energy optimization for controlling, monitoring buildings and running energy optimization, greatly contributing to creating a BIM construction community with energy practices. The solution described, known as energy-bim.com platform, disseminates energy efficient practices and community engagement and provides support for building managers in implementing energy efficient optimization plans.					19th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises (PRO-VE 2018)19th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises (PRO-VE 2018)	SEP 17-19, 2018SEP 17-19, 2018	IFIP WG 5 5 COVE; Soc Collaborat Networks; Cardiff Univ; Nova Univ Lisbon; UNINOVA; Univ AmsterdamIFIP WG 5 5 COVE; Soc Collaborat Networks; Cardiff Univ; Nova Univ Lisbon; UNINOVA; Univ Amsterdam	Cardiff, WALESCardiff, WALES	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1868-4238	1868-422X	978-3-319-99126-9	WOS:000449239300046		J	Alvarez, Jose M.; Pasian, Claudio; Lal, Rattan; Lopez-Nunez, Rafael; Fernandez, Manuel				de la Puente, Jose M.

Whereas wide range of techniques of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration have been studied in row crops and forest systems, little research has been done on the ornamental horticulture. The ornamental industrial sector has indeed some negative impacts on the global environment, but also presents opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and increase C sequestration. Thus the objective of this study was to synthesize the potential contributions of some substrates used in the horticultural sector to carbon sequestration. The specific focus of the review is on the possible use of compost, vermicompost and biochar as soilless substrate substitutes for containerized ornamental plants production. Around 11 million kilograms of sphagnum peat moss are used annually in the world for horticultural production. Therefore, the potential of using compost, vermicompost and biochar as growing media is assessed on the basis of data from greenhouse studies. Peat-based substrate can be substituted up to 30% to 35% by compost or vermicompost and up to 20% to 25% by biochar. Some examples from field studies are included to conduct the life cycle assessment of using these growth media. An estimate of C storage on the long-term basis in soil indicates up to 3 million tons of CO2 equivalent as the maximum C potential storage per year in the global productive sector if the peat-based growing media are substituted by compost/vermicompost and biochar at the ratios mentioned above. Finally, synergies between compost vermicompost and biochar are discussed when these materials are combined as growing media additives and research gaps in this area of activity have been identified for further research.									2	0	0	0	1	2	2	6	1695-971X	2171-9292		WOS:000448042200004		J	Dewangan, Ashish; Yadav, Ashok Kumar; Mallick, Ashis								Current scenario of biodiesel development in India: prospects and challenges								ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS				40	20			2494	2501		10.1080/15567036.2018.1502849				2018	2018	For adeveloping nation like India, the current energy portfolio is dominated by fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and petroleum products. Due to the rapid depletion and limited available resources, the price of fossil fuel increases. Also, fossil fuel induces climate change, environmental pollution, andrising global temperature. There is urgent need to shift from conventional energy to renewable energy source for sustainable and economic growth and to enhance a country's energy security. Biofuel offers an attractive source of energy for the substitution of fossil fuels, and looking at the huge demand for diesel in all sectors of the economy, the biodiesel is being viewed as the best substitute for diesel. The other advantage for biofuel promotion in India is climate change mitigation through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This article provides the current status of biodiesel development in India and discusses the role played by thecentre and state government in promoting second-generation feedstock (nonedible seeds) and third-generation feedstock (algae) for biodiesel production.									6	0	0	0	0	6	1	1	1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000444494700015		J	Eker, Sibel; Zimmermann, Nici; Carnohan, Shane; Davies, Mike				Zimmermann, Nici/Q-7969-2019; Eker, Sibel/I-3780-2019; Zimmermann, Nici/O-3196-2017	Zimmermann, Nici/0000-0003-2344-7238; Eker, Sibel/0000-0003-2264-132X; Zimmermann, Nici/0000-0003-2344-7238; Davies, Michael/0000-0003-2173-7063; Carnohan, Shane/0000-0003-0083-0269			Participatory system dynamics modelling for housing, energy and wellbeing interactions								BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION				46	7			738	754		10.1080/09613218.2017.1362919				2018	2018	The built environment is a key target of decarbonization policies. However, such policies often have a narrow objective and narrow focus, resulting in policy-resistance' and unintended consequences. The literature attributes these unintended consequences to a narrow financial focus, adverse incentives, and inadequate handling of knowledge, skills, communication and feedback gaps, but it provides little advice on how these complex interactions can be captured. This paper illustrates the development and application of an integrated approach to address these complex interactions with regard to housing performance, energy, communal spaces and wellbeing. In particular, it explores the dynamics created by these relationships with simulation modelling in participatory settings, and with a diverse group of stakeholders. The simulation results suggest that monitoring is key to improve the performance of the housing stock besides energy efficiency; and investments in communal spaces positively affect the adoption of energy-efficiency measures and the wellbeing of residents. The evaluation results for participatory workshops show this approach was found useful by the stakeholders for supporting more integrated decision-making about housing. In future research, this approach can be implemented for policy problems in specific contexts.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	6	0961-3218	1466-4321		WOS:000441993000004		J	ARUOVA, Liazat B.

The problem of the greenhouse effect today is a manifestation of the global environmental crisis throughout the world. The production of cement is growing rapidly in the republic, and the demand for it will increase continuously. Cement producers are also one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, as are thermal power plants. A high scale of energy consumption and a large number of emissions into the environment is characterized by the production of cement, which includes multi-stage mechanical high-temperature processing of raw materials. High energy consumption and significant discharges to the air atmosphere of greenhouse gases are also characterized by the production of reinforced concrete structures. The calculation of greenhouse gas emissions at cement manufacturing enterprises has outlined the main directions for reducing the amount of greenhouse gases at cement manufacturing enterprises. The calculation of heat treatment of reinforced concrete structures with natural gas was made, which indicated: reduction of emissions at the stage of decarbonization and reduction of emissions in the fuel consumption of cements, reduction of emissions at the stage of heat treatment due to reduction of energy consumption spent in the manufacture of reinforced concrete products and structures. The authors proposed effective ways of solving this problem by means of renewable energy sources. The development and implementation of innovative technologies that promote environmental protection today play an important role in terms of sustainable development. It is necessary to introduce new environmentally effective technologies that make it possible to ensure the interaction between economic development and environmental protection at all levels. Modern development of production must correspond to the state of the environment. The introduction of environmentally friendly technologies today must effectively solve environmental problems, providing a new attitude to nature, coordinating production and natural processes in a coherent system, managed by people.			Рассмотрено решение проблемы уменьшения эмиссии парниковых выбросов при организации высокоэнергоемких предприятий по производству цемента, а также железобетонных и других конструкций, изделий в Республике Казахстан. Проблема парникового эффекта сегодня - это проявление глобального экологического кризиса во всем мире. Казахстан ратифицировал Киотский протокол еще в 2009 г., затем было подписано Парижское соглашение в соответствии с указом президента Республики Казахстан от 20 июля 2016 г., а 27 октября 2016 г. парламент Республики Казахстан ратифицировал данное соглашение. Таким образом, Казахстан присоединился к уже вступившему в силу Парижскому соглашению. Ратификация Парижского соглашения показывает готовность Казахстана участвовать в решении одной из ключевых глобальных проблем cовременности, каковой является изменение климата. Страны-участницы Парижского соглашения договорились не допускать повышения средних температур более чем на 2 °С к 2100 г., иначе все человечество будет сталкиваться с необратимыми последствиями для экологической системы. В Республике Казахстан отмечаются высокие темпы строительства. С 2010 г. ведутся работы по модернизации железных и автомобильных дорог, планируется рост транспортной инфраструктуры по маршрутам, связывающим Китай и Европу, для расширения международной торговли. Увеличиваются объемы строительства в рамках программы «Доступное жилье-2020», при реализации которой поддерживаются национальные производители строительных материалов. Производство цемента быстро растет в республике, и потребность в нем будет непрерывно увеличиваться. Однако это производство становится одним из крупных источников выбросов парниковых газов, как и тепловые электростанции. Высоким энергопотреблением и большим количеством выбросов в окружающую среду характеризуется производство цемента, которое включает многостадийную механическую высокотемпературную переработку сырья. В республике предприятия по производству цемента применяют в основном «мокрый» способ, сегодня начинают работать предприятия, использующие «сухой» способ. При производстве 6500 тыс. т в год цемента сжигается в пересчете на уголь 1 947 тыс. т условного топлива. Высокое энергопотребление и существенные выбросы парниковых газов в атмосферу имеет также производство железобетонных конструкций. В основном процесс тепловой обработки конечного продукта происходит в различных термокамерах при температуре свыше 100 °С в течение 10-12 ч. Крупные предприятия по производству различных видов бетонов имеют котельные установки, работающие на разных видах органического топлива. При их сжигании электростанции с дымовыми газами выбрасывают в воздушное пространство достаточно большое количество вредных веществ (золы, оксиды азота, углерода, серы). Выполненный расчет эмиссии парниковых выбросов на предприятиях по производству цемента показал основные направления снижения количества парниковых газов на предприятиях по получению цементов. Тепловая обработка железобетонных конструкций природным газом позволила уменьшить выбросы: на этапе декарбонизации, при топливопотреблении цементов, на этапе тепловой обработки в результате сокращения энергопотребления, затрачиваемого при изготовлении железобетонных изделий и конструкций. Экологическая безопасность - важная составляющая национальной безопасности страны, которая не может быть отделена от экологических проблем.

Новые экологически безопасные эффективные технологии позволят совершенствовать работу по экономическому развитию и защите окружающей среды на всех уровнях. Современное развитие производства не должно наносить вред окружающей среде. Внедрение безопасных экологически чистых технологий сегодня должно быть актуально для решения экологических проблем, сохранения окружающей среды.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	0869-7019			RSCI:35129447		J	Balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard; Bin Marsono, Abdul Kadir; Kermanshahi, Emad Kasra				balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard/T-2452-2017	balasbaneh, Ali Tighnavard/0000-0002-7823-0477			Balancing of life cycle carbon and cost appraisal on alternative wall and roof design verification for residential building								CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND				18	3			274	300		10.1108/CI-03-2017-0024				2018	2018	Purpose The purpose of this study is to describe life cycle cost (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluation for single story building house in Malaysia. Two objective functions, namely, LCA and LCC, were evaluated for each design and a total of 20 alternatives were analyzed. Two wall schemes that have been adopted from two different recent studies toward mitigation of climate change require clarification in both life cycle objectives.Design/methodology/approach For this strategic life cycle assessment, Simapro 8.3 tool has been chosen over a 50-year life span. LCC analysis was also used to determine not only the most energy-efficient strategy, but also the most economically feasible one. A present value (PV)-based economic analysis takes LCC into account.Findings The results will appear in present value and LC carbon footprint saving, both individually and in combination with each other. Result of life cycle management shows that timber wall-wooden post and beam covered by steel stud (W5) and wood truss with concrete roof tiles (R1) released less carbon emission to atmosphere and have lower life cycle cost over their life span. W5R1 releases 35 per cent less CO2 emission than the second best choice and costs 25 per cent less.Originality/value The indicator assessed was global warming, and as the focus was on GHG emissions, the focus of this study was mainly in the context of Malaysian construction, although the principles apply universally. The result would support the adoption of sustainable building for building sector.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	5	1471-4175	1477-0857		WOS:000438916200001		S	Rohmah, Nabila Asyiqotur; Apriliani, Erna			IOP					Rainfall estimation with TFR model using Ensemble Kalman filter								INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICS: PURE, APPLIED AND COMPUTATION		Journal of Physics Conference Series		974						UNSP 012031	10.1088/1742-6596/974/1/012031				2018	2018	Rainfall fluctuation can affect condition of other environment, correlated with economic activity and public health. The increasing of global average temperature is influenced by the increasing of CO2 in the atmosphere, which caused climate change. Meanwhile, the forests as carbon sinks that help keep the carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Climate change caused by rainfall intensity deviations can affect the economy of a region, and even countries. It encourages research on rainfall associated with an area of forest. In this study, the mathematics model that used is a model which describes the global temperatures, forest cover, and seasonal rainfall called the TFR (temperature, forest cover, and rainfall) model. The model will be discretized first, and then it will be estimated by the method of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The result shows that the more ensembles used in estimation, the better the result is. Also, the accurateness of simulation result is influenced by measurement variable. If a variable is measurement data, the result of simulation is better.

The simulation produced interesting results. While gross climate damage under the BAU scenario increased to RM7.1 billion in 2030, the commensurate damage under the slow, moderate and high hydrogen adaptation fell to MYR2.0 billion, MYR1.7 billion and MYR1.2 billion, respectively. CO2 emissions will fall from 214MT under the BAU scenario to 203MT, 176MT and 122MT, respectively, under the slow, moderate and high scenarios, respectively. Although real GDP is expected to stagnate over the period 2015-2030 under all three adaptation scenarios, the welfare benefits are expected to expand from the greening environment. While the high adaptation scenarios offer the best quantitative results, the choice of the intensity of adaptation will depend on the regulatory framework and the extent to which consumers can adapt.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	9	1354-7860	1469-9648		WOS:000435698000006		J	van der Heijden, Jeroen				van der Heijden, Jeroen/K-3773-2015	van der Heijden, Jeroen/0000-0001-6188-0556			From leaders to majority: a frontrunner paradox in built-environment climate governance experimentation								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT				61	8			1383	1401		10.1080/09640568.2017.1350147				2018	2018	This paper seeks to better understand the possible paradox of frontrunners in experimental climate governance. This paradox refers to the situation where frontrunners are required to push boundaries in terms of developing governance innovations and to experiment with these, but where, at the same time, a too strong focus on frontrunners may result in a situation where lessons from these experiments and the innovations developed do not resonate with the majority. In such a situation, an innovation may not be capable of being scaled up or of being transferred to another context. This paper draws lessons from a series of nine experimental and innovative governance instruments for low-carbon building development and transformation in Australia. It points out that for these instruments the frontrunners paradox provides a partial explanation as to why they have not yet been able to scale up from a small group of industry leaders to the large majority.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0964-0568	1360-0559		WOS:000432205600005		J	Ford, Alistair; Dawson, Richard; Blythe, Phil; Barr, Stuart					Blythe, Phil/0000-0003-2134-1253			Land-use transport models for climate change mitigation and adaptation planning								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND LAND USE				11	1			83	101		10.5198/jtlu.2018.1209				2018	2018	The adoption of the Paris Agreement has committed the world to limiting anthropogenic climate change to 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels, adapting to climate risks, and fostering climate resilience. Given the high proportion of global emissions released by cities and the concentration of people living in urban areas, this will require an unprecedented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and transformation of the built environment on a yet unparalleled timescale. This poses substantial challenges for urban land-use and transport planning and for the use of land-use transport models (LUTM), which have historically been developed to test incremental changes rather than the rapid transformations implied by the Paris Agreement.This paper sets out the need for a new generation of tools to support the planning of a transition toward a low-carbon and resilient future, arguing that land-use and transport modeling tools are crucial to support this process. Recent developments in urban integrated assessment that link models of land-use and transport with other environmental models of greenhouse gas emissions and climate hazards show promise as platforms to assess the potential of urban policies in achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement.Hie paper concludes by defining challenges for the LUTM community if it is to achieve these goals. Crucial will be the adoption of new modeling approaches to better represent rapid social and technological change and to concurrently assess the resilience and sustainability implications of different land-use and transport policies. Simple models to explore multiple scenarios of change must be integrated with more sophisticated models for detailed design. Collaborative approaches will be necessary to allow multiple stakeholders to use these tools to explore urban futures and design radical urban transitions across multiple and interdependent urban sectors.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	7	1938-7849			WOS:000432300300006		J	Olawuyi, Damilola S.

Several studies on how to fix Africa's climate technology needs, including policy prescriptions by African leaders, tend to focus primarily on the need for more technology transfer to the African continent. In contrast, this article emphasises how African countries can proactively address current technology gaps by strengthening their domestic capacities to absorb, assimilate and deploy imported climate technologies. This article examines the importance of climate technology absorption as a critical component of a holistic climate technology diffusion plan for Africa. It discusses inadequate access to information about imported climate technologies, weak legal protection for imported technologies, lack of domestic capacities to deploy and maintain imported technologies, the weak regulatory environment to stimulate clean technology entrepreneurship, and the absence or inadequacy of climate change laws, as barriers that must be addressed in order to effectively bridge current climate technology gaps in Africa.									3	0	0	0	0	3	0	4	0264-6811	2376-4538		WOS:000429064400004		J	Siegmeier, Jan; Mattauch, Linus; Franks, Max; Klenert, David; Schultes, Anselm; Edenhofer, Ottmar				Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013	Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Klenert, David/0000-0003-3186-0938; Franks, Max/0000-0003-3758-6386			The fiscal benefits of stringent climate change mitigation: an overview								CLIMATE POLICY				18	3	SI		352	367		10.1080/14693062.2017.1400943				2018	2018	The Paris Agreement's very ambitious mitigation goals, notably to 'pursue efforts' to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, imply that climate policy will remain a national affair for some time. One key obstacle to very ambitious national mitigation is that some policy makers perceive this to be in competition with major goals of fiscal policy, such as public investment or debt reduction. However, climate policy may actually contribute to these other objectives. Importantly, many fiscal implications of substantial carbon prices, which are essential for stringent mitigation targets such as the 1.5 degrees C goal, have long been neglected by economic analyses of climate change mitigation.We systematically review recent contributions on interactions between climate policy and public finance, which include many topics beyond the classic 'double dividend' of environmental tax swaps. We can thus identify new conclusions about climate policy designs that may overcome fiscal objections and research gaps. We find that national climate policy often aligns with other objectives, provided that climate policies and fiscal policies are integrated well. A first class of interactions concerns public revenue-raising: carbon pricing can replace distortionary taxes and alleviate international tax competition; climate policy also changes asset values, which impacts the base of non-climate taxes and boosts productive investment. Second, they concern public spending, which needs to be restructured as a part of climate policy, while carbon pricing revenues may be recycled for public investment. Third, distributional impacts of climate policies include changes to household expenditures, to asset values and to employment; balancing them often requires fiscal policies.Our findings underline that jointly considering climate policy and fiscal policy can help to make substantial mitigation politically feasible.									3	0	0	0	0	3	3	12	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000427273800006		J	Marquez-Ramos, Laura								The environmental impact of renewables								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING				14	2			143	158		10.1504/IJGW.2018.10011103				2018	2018	The aim of this research is two-fold. Firstly, to introduce a trilemma of a global sustainable energy system and, secondly, to perform a quantitative assessment of the effect of renewables on the environmental impacts of electricity generation, taking into account the existing divergences between developed and developing countries. In a multi-regional, multi-country, and dynamic approach, a regression analysis is performed to determine the causal relationship between renewables and environmental indicators on climate change, human toxicity, respiratory impacts, ionising radiation, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, land use and mineral and fossil resource depletion. Results show that renewable energy consumption significantly improves environmental outcomes in both developed and developing countries. As a result, renewables represent a suitable climate change mitigation option.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	1758-2083	1758-2091		WOS:000427488200001		J	Lee, Jaekune; Kee, Hoyoung; Byun, Wanhee; 이정범								Analyzing the Economic and Environmental Benefits of Intercity Carpool			도시간 카풀의 경제-환경적 효과 분석					Journal of the Korean Society for Environmental Technology	한국환경기술학회지			19	1			30	36						2018	2018	The increase in vehicles is causing many urban problems. In order to solve these problems, a policy encouraging voluntary participation from citizens is necessary. Sharing of transportation is one transportation demand management technique that can solve these problems. This study quantitatively analyzed the effects of carpool on the economic and environmental benefits through the case study of the Land and Housing Institute. The economic benefit from carpooling was about 14.7 million won, and the economic benefit from the greenhouse gas reduction was about 650,000 won. Based on these studies, it is expected that the economic and environmental effect will increase if it is generalized the vehicles for commuting to Sejong city. It is necessary to analyze the impact of urban carpool on the economy and environment by analyzing the willingness to carpool and calculating participation rates in the future.				자동차의 증가는 많은 도시문제를 야기하고 있다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 시민의 자발적 참여를 유도하는 정책이 필요하며 교통수단의 공유는 이러한 문제를 해결할 수 있는 교통수요관리 기법 중 하나이다. 본 연구는 공유교통의 일환인 카풀에 대해 LH연구원의 사례를 통하여 카풀의 효과를 경제적, 환경적 편익으로 나누어 계량적으로 분석하였다. 카풀을 통한 경제적 효과는 약 1,470만원으로 나타났으며, 온실가스 감소로 인한 경제적 편익은 약 65만원에 이르는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 연구를 바탕으로 연구소가 많이 이전된 세종시나 도시내 출퇴근용 카풀이 일반화될 경우 그 경제적, 환경적 효과는 크게 늘어날 것으로 판단된다. 향후, 각 도시의 카풀 이용 의사를 분석하고 참여율을 산정함으로써 각 도시별 카풀이 경제 및 환경에 미치는 영향을 분석해 볼 필요가 있다고 판단된다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1229-8425			KJD:ART002319396		J	Zachariadis, Theodoros; Michopoulos, Apostolos; Vougiouklakis, Yannis; Piripitsi, Katerina; Ellinopoulos, Christodoulos; Struss, Benjamin				Michopoulos, Apostolos/D-2264-2015	Michopoulos, Apostolos/0000-0003-3250-998X			Determination of Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency Measures in Buildings with the Aid of Multiple Indices								ENERGIES				11	1					191	10.3390/en11010191				JAN 2018	2018	Energy refurbishments of buildings can substantially contribute to economy-wide energy efficiency improvements, leading to decarbonisation and additional sustainability benefits. Prioritising the most economically promising investments is not straightforward because apart from cost-effectiveness calculations, several real-world constraints have to be taken into account. This paper describes an approach to assess the economically viable energy efficiency potential in the building sector of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, with a combination of detailed engineering modelling, cost-effectiveness calculations and real-world considerations of budgetary, technical, behavioural and market constraints. We examine diverse cost-effectiveness indices and come up with a proposal for prioritising specific energy investments such as the installation of heat pumps, insulation of roofs, and replacement of lighting and electronic equipmentwithout however ignoring other measures that may be economically less favourable but can realistically be implemented in a limited number of buildings. Finally we address the governance of energy efficiency policies, focusing on weaknesses of the current regulatory environment in Cyprus, which can be generalised for many other countries facing similar dilemmas.									4	0	0	0	0	4	4	6	1996-1073			WOS:000424397600191		J	Tozer, Laura; Klenk, Nicole					Klenk, Nicole Lisa/0000-0001-8224-6992			Discourses of carbon neutrality and imaginaries of urban futures								ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE				35				174	181		10.1016/j.erss.2017.10.017				JAN 2018	2018	By analyzing the discourses in carbon governance texts, this paper identifies visions for the built environment in carbon neutral urban futures and the storylines driving those urban imaginaries. Local authorities have begun aiming for 'carbon neutral' transformations, but it is not clear what kind of city will result. Different imaginaries about the futurity of energy will send cities down divergent sociotechnical paths. Using discourse analysis, this paper identifies the storylines underlying sociotechnical imaginaries of urban carbon neutrality among the 17 founding members of the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, which is a network of local governments mainly from Europe and North America pioneering deep decarbonization. This paper elaborates on five storylines in urban carbon governance texts: 1. The diverse meanings of carbon neutrality 2. The new economy of carbon control 3. The city as a laboratory 4. Technological fixes and the modern city and 5. Reframing what it means to be a 'good' urban citizen. The developing sociotechnical imaginary of urban carbon neutrality is structuring shifts in policy and practice. Trends include a focus on technological fixes and innovation as solutions where private capital is a fundamental partner, as well as reflexivity about the experimental nature of achieving carbon neutrality.									5	0	0	0	0	5	4	14	2214-6296	2214-6326		WOS:000425247200018		J	Dreier, Dennis; Silveira, Semida; Khatiwada, Dilip; Fonseca, Keiko V.

Particular emphasis is put on the operation phase (Tank-to Wheel, TTW) of the city buses using the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR). The simulations are based on real-world driving patterns collected from Curitiba, comprising 42 driving cycles that represent city bus operation on seven BRT routes with six operation times for each.Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses use 30% and 75% less WTW fossil energy per distance compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (19.46 MJ(fossil),(WTW)/km). This gives an absolute reduction of 1115 gCO(2)e,(WTW)/km in WTW GHG emissions when operating a plug-in hybrid-electric city bus instead of a conventional two-axle city bus (1539 gCO(2)e,(WTW)/km). However, a conventional bi-articulated city bus can be environment-friendlier than hybrid electric city buses in terms of WTW fossil energy use and WTW GHG emissions per passenger distance, if its passenger capacity is sufficiently utilised. Nonetheless, the plug-in hybrid-electric city bus remains the most energy-efficient and less polluting option. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric powertrains offer the possibility to achieve much higher levels of decarbonisation in the BRT system in Curitiba than the blending mandate of 7%(vol) biodiesel into diesel implemented in Brazil in 2016. In addition, the simulations show that TTW energy use can considerably vary by up to 77% between different operation times, BRT routes and types of city buses.In conclusion, advanced powertrains and large passenger capacity utilisation can promote sustainability in Curitiba's BRT system. The results of this analysis provide important insights for decision makers both in Curitiba and other cities with similar conditions.									10	0	0	0	0	10	1	17	1361-9209			WOS:000425198400010		J	Nicolosi, Emily; Corbett, Julia B.

Yet, studies in this vein derive from a number of disconnected literatures with a variety of place concepts employed. We set out to assess the current state of knowledge in this field and provide a framework for analysing dimensions of relations to place and their links with environmental engagement. We systematically analysed the characteristics of 66 studies identified for: focus of research, location, methods, and findings, particularly whether relationships to place aided in environmental engagement. We also categorised the studies according to our dimensions of place relations framework, cultural and environmental contexts, and intensity of climate impacts experienced. The answer to our guiding research question - whether place attachment was an effective way to communicate with people about climate change and get them actively engaged with it - was yes (74.2%), but with considerable variation according to these characteristics and dimensions. Based on this analysis, we identify gaps in current research and suggest critical paths for future research, especially in terms of geography and demography because of their implications for justice and equity in the processes of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Needed future research includes studies of place relations in regards to climate change specifically, studies in the Global South, of minority populations, beyond rural areas, and qualitative or mixed-method studies able to draw out the complexities of relations to place.									6	0	0	0	0	6	2	29	1354-9839	1469-6711		WOS:000418959800005		J	Schuetze, Franziska; Fuerst, Steffen; Mielke, Jahel; Steudle, Gesine A.; Wolf, Sarah; Jaeger, Carlo C.

Such a sustainability transition represents a non-marginal change, driven by behavioral factors and systemic interactions. However, typical economic models used to assess a sustainability transition focus on marginal changes around a local optimum, whichby constructionlead to negative effects. Thus, these models do not allow evaluating a sustainability transition that might have substantial positive effects. This paper examines which mechanisms need to be included in a standard computable general equilibrium model to overcome these limitations and to give a more comprehensive view of the effects of climate change mitigation. Simulation results show that, given an ambitious greenhouse gas emission constraint and a price of carbon, positive economic effects are possible if (1) technical progress results (partly) endogenously from the model and (2) a policy intervention triggering an increase of investment is introduced. Additionally, if (3) the investment behavior of firms is influenced by their sales expectations, the effects are amplified. The results provide suggestions for policy-makers, because the outcome indicates that investment-oriented climate policies can lead to more desirable outcomes in economic, social and environmental terms.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	10	2071-1050			WOS:000419231500070		J	Lewandowski, Stefan								Corporate Carbon and Financial Performance: The Role of Emission Reductions								BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT				26	8			1196	1211		10.1002/bse.1978				DEC 2017	2017	This article uses econometric techniques to examine the effect of corporate carbon performance on corporate financial performance. I extend the existing literature in this research field by differentiating between two measurement perspectives: carbon performance expressed as annually reported carbon dioxide (CO2) emission equivalents and improvements in carbon performance over time. Thereby, the article re-addresses the research question when and how does it pay to be green?' in the context of carbon emissions and climate change mitigation. Using a nonlinear modeling technique, the findings indicate that it pays to be green for companies with superior carbon performance but not for companies with inferior carbon performance. The results also show that carbon emission mitigation is linearly and significantly positive related to return on sales (ROS) but negatively related to Tobin's q. These contradictory findings help us to understand why - in spite of growing regulatory pressure - companies have been slow to respond with effective action to tackle climate change beyond marginal efficiency improvements that correspond to low-hanging fruits'. The empirical analysis is based on an unbalanced sample of 7625 firm-year observations covering carbon emission data (Scope 1 and Scope 2) for 1640 international firms from 2003 to 2015.

The novelty of the study stands on the approaches adopted to describe environmental performance. The first approach concerns performance in terms of output, direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, while the second one is based on environmental intention of mitigating climate change, including climate change policy and emission reduction initiatives. The Climate Performance Leadership Index is employed as a measure for climate change disclosure level, incorporating initiatives contributing to climate change mitigation, adaptation and transparency. Ordered logit regression is the appropriate methodology for the data employed concerning firms listed on FTSE 350. According to our findings, environmental performance for both adopted approaches entails a positive effect on climate change disclosure, a result that is consistent with voluntary disclosure theory.

Finally, findings provide an insight into managers' strategic behavior towards climate change issues.

With 80% of agricultural land dedicated to livestock production, the sector is an important lever to attenuate land requirements for food production and carbon emissions from land use change. In this study, we quantify impacts of changing human diets and livestock productivity on land dynamics and depletion of carbon stored in vegetation, litter and soils. Across all investigated productivity pathways, lower consumption of livestock products can substantially reduce deforestation (47-55%) and cumulative carbon losses (34-57%). On the supply side, already minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems leads to substantial CO2 emission abatement, but the emission saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is limited, also involving trade-offs with soil carbon stocks. If accounting for uncertainties related to future trade restrictions, crop yields and pasture productivity, the range of projected carbon savings from changing diets increases to 23-78%. Highest abatement of carbon emissions (63-78%) can be achieved if reduced consumption of animal-based products is combined with sustained investments into productivity increases in plant production. Our analysis emphasizes the importance to integrate demand- and supply-side oriented mitigation strategies and to combine efforts in the crop and livestock sector to enable synergies for climate protection.									7	0	0	4	0	7	0	43	0921-8181	1872-6364		WOS:000419410700001		J	Houghton, Adele; Castillo-Salgado, Carlos					Houghton, Adele/0000-0002-6861-1591			Health Co-Benefits of Green Building Design Strategies and Community Resilience to Urban Flooding: A Systematic Review of the Evidence								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				14	12					1519	10.3390/ijerph14121519				DEC 2017	2017	Climate change is increasingly exacerbating existing population health hazards, as well as resulting in new negative health effects. Flooding is one particularly deadly example of its amplifying and expanding effect on public health. This systematic review considered evidence linking green building strategies in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) (LEED) Rating System with the potential to reduce negative health outcomes following exposure to urban flooding events. Queries evaluated links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to urban flooding, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits to leveraging green building design to enhance flooding resilience included: improving the interface between humans and wildlife and reducing the risk of waterborne disease, flood-related morbidity and mortality, and psychological harm. We conclude that collaborations among the public health, climate change, civil society, and green building sectors to enhance community resilience to urban flooding could benefit population health.									4	0	0	2	0	4	2	15		1660-4601		WOS:000423699400082	29210981	J	Plevin, Richard J.

Some analysts rely on attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA), limiting the analytic scope to the direct supply chain, whereas others supplement an ALCA result with an estimate of land-use change (LUC) emissions intensity. Other analysts have used consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA), with methods ranging from static market assessments to identify the likely marginal product and supplier, to running partial and general equilibrium models to estimate changes in global production and consumption. In this article, we consider another alternativeusing an integrated assessment model (IAM) as a platform for CLCA of biofuels. In this article (part I of II), we focus on the methodological challenges of this approach. In part II, we present a case study using one IAMthe global change assessment model (GCAM)to estimate the climate effects of several biofuels.									8	0	0	3	0	8	16	64	1088-1980	1530-9290		WOS:000417766200005		J	Moreira, M.

Beyond its use for soil amendment and carbon sequestration, other value-added applications, such as a green environmental sorbent for different types of pollutants, are also of increasing interest.This paper reviews the available literature on the use of various feedstocks for biochar production as an initial step to compile the required inventory data from material flow data analysis. The environmental evaluation of different schemes of biochar production in a life cycle perspective reports the environmental impacts of the different alternatives, with more sustainable profiles than the use of activated carbon as conventional adsorption material. Moreover, most systems were validated as negative carbon processes with favorable performance regarding climate change mitigation. In particular, materials based on lignocellulosic waste were responsible for the highest environmental benefits, mainly due to their largest energy potential in comparison with other feedstocks.									14	0	0	7	0	14	9	86	0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000415640100016	28843643	J	Andreas, Jan-Justus; Burns, Charlotte; Touza, Julia					Burns, Charlotte Jennie/0000-0001-9944-0417			Renewable Energy as a Luxury? A Qualitative Comparative Analysis of the Role of the Economy in the EU's Renewable Energy Transitions During the 'Double Crisis'								ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS				142				81	90		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.06.011				DEC 2017	2017	The European Union (EU) faces a double crisis: both economic and environmental, which has brought into stark relief the question of whether climate change mitigation and economic growth are mutually exclusive. Is saving the environment a 'luxury' reserved for wealthy countries, with less affluent countries being too poor to be green? We seek to address this important and timely question using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyse the causal relationship between economic growth and stability, and the expansion of renewable electricity shares among the European Union's (EU) 28 member states during the recent economic recession (2008-2013). Our paper, analyses the recent economic and financial crisis and its effects on sustainability transitions, and establishes a new indicator for progress in renewable electricity transitions in the context of Europe's 2020 targets. It therefore extends the 'sustainability as a luxury' debate to include renewable energy. The analysis reveals an ambivalent picture of the role of wealth in renewable energy transitions (RET) in Europe. Indeed, driven by the EU's common renewable energy targets, the findings suggest that RETs are promoted both because, and in spite of the means. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Incentivizing developing countries to participate in climate change mitigation often requires a mechanism for developed countries to finance projects in poorer countries. While several funding institutions have been established, African country participation has been low. In this analysis, we conduct interviews with climate change policy stakeholders from across the continent and find a general consensus that a lack of institutional capacity has limited the participation of African countries in existing climate change mitigation programs. To confirm this qualitative observation, we use data from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank to examine the correlation between country-year measures of institutional capacity and the number of projects implemented by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and find that better institutional quality is associated with more GEF projects implemented in a country-year. We propose to address the lack of institutional capacity with the creation of regional institution, or Climate Change Mitigation Institution (CCMI), that specializes in building local capacity by leveraging external capacity as well as facilitates the integration of African countries into global climate change mitigation efforts by improving capacity, strengthening research and development, forming partnerships, and coordinating the disbursement of financing.

For example, a number of decision-support tools on transport planning provide information on expected effects of different measures (actions, policies, or interventions) on air quality, often combined with information on noise pollution or mitigation costs. These tools range in complexity and scale of applicability, from city to international, and include one or several polluting sectors. However, evaluation of the need and utility of tools to support decisions on such linked issues is often lacking, especially for tools intended to support local authorities at the city scale. Here we assessed the need for and value of combining air pollution and climate change mitigation measures into one decision-support tool and the existing policy context in which such a tool might be used. We developed a prototype decision-support tool for evaluating measures for coordinated management of air quality and climate change; and administered a survey in which respondents used the prototype to answer questions about demand for such tools and requirements to make them useful. Additionally, the survey asked questions about participants' awareness of linkages between air pollution and climate change that are crucial for considering synergies and trade-offs among mitigation measures. Participants showed a high understanding of the linkages between air pollution and climate change, especially recognizing that emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants come from the same source. Survey participants were: European, predominantly German; employed across a range of governmental, non-governmental and research organizations; and responsible for a diversity of issues, primarily involving climate change, air pollution or environment. Survey results showed a lack of awareness of decision-support tools and little implementation or regular use. However, respondents expressed a general need for such tools while also recognizing barriers to their implementation, such as limited legal support or lack of time, finances, or manpower. The main barrier identified through this study is the mismatch between detailed information needed from such tools to make them useful at the local implementation scale and the coarser scale information readily available for developing such tools. Significant research efforts at the local scale would be needed to populate decision-support tools with salient mitigation alternatives at the location of implementation. Although global-or regional-scale information can motivate local action towards sustainability, effective on-the-ground implementation of coordinated measures requires knowledge of local circumstances and impacts, calling for active engagement of the local research communities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	14	2325-1026			WOS:000416799600001		J	Weindl, Isabelle; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon; Rolinski, Susanne; Biewald, Anne; Lotze-Campen, Hermann; Mueller, Christoph; Dietrich, Jan Philipp; Humpenoeder, Florian; Stevanovic, Miodrag; Schaphoff, Sibyll; Popp, Alexander				Topp, Cairistiona FE/L-8439-2016; Muller, Christoph/E-4812-2016; Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Stevanovic, Miodrag/B-8303-2018	Topp, Cairistiona FE/0000-0002-7064-638X; Muller, Christoph/0000-0002-9491-3550; Stevanovic, Miodrag/0000-0003-1799-186X; Lotze-Campen, Hermann/0000-0002-0003-5508			Livestock production and the water challenge of future food supply: Implications of agricultural management and dietary choices								GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS				47				121	132		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.09.010				NOV 2017	2017	Human activities use more than half of accessible freshwater, above all for agriculture. Most approaches for reconciling water conservation with feeding a growing population focus on the cropping sector. However, livestock production is pivotal to agricultural resource use, due to its low resource-use efficiency upstream in the food supply chain. Using a global modelling approach, we quantify the current and future contribution of livestock production, under different demand-and supply-side scenarios, to the consumption of "green" precipitation water infiltrated into the soil and "blue" freshWater withdrawn from rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Currently, cropland feed production accounts for 38% of crop water consumption and grazing involves 29% of total agricultural water consumption (9990 km(3) yr(-1)). Our analysis shows that changes in diets and livestock productivity have substantial implications for future consumption of agricultural blue water (19-36% increase compared to current levels) and green water (26-69% increase), but they can, at best, slow down trends of rising water requirements for decades to come. However, moderate productivity reductions in highly intensive livestock systems are possible without aggravating water scarcity. Productivity gains in developing regions decrease total agricultural water consumption, but lead to expansion of irrigated agriculture, due to the shift from grassland/green water to cropland/blue water resources. While the magnitude of the livestock water footprint gives cause for concern, neither dietary choices nor changes in livestock productivity will solve the water challenge of future food supply, unless accompanied by dedicated water protection policies.									4	0	0	0	0	4	6	47	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000418392300012		J	Tsai, Wen-Tien								Implementation status of Taiwan carbon footprint (CFP) system and a case study of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation								SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY				35				331	335		10.1016/j.scs.2017.08.021				NOV 2017	2017	The transportation sector in Taiwan has made a significant contribution to reducing atmospheric pollution such as lowering greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, by adopting the carbon footprint (CFP) label. GHGs are a major cause of global warming. This paper analyzes the carbon footprint (CFP) system and its application to high-speed railways in Taiwan over the decade 2003-2013. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita in Taiwan increased slightly from 10.3 to 10.7 t between 2003 and 2013. However, overall energy intensity has improved gradually, falling from 10.0 liters of oil equivalent (LOE)/10(3)$NT in 2003 to 7.8 LOE/10(3)$NT in 2013 due to some high energy efficiency and low carbon emission measures implemented by the Taiwan government such as the combined heat and power and green transportation policy updated. This paper describes the analysis of GHG emission trends, two central regulations (i.e., the Basic Environment Act and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act) for promoting the CFP-label system and the system's implementation status in Taiwan over the past 10 years. Finally, a case study of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation demonstrates the successful implementation of the green transportation CFP-labeling service, the first such certified railway system in Asia. The certified CFP label is printed on the ticket with 38 g CO2 equivalent per person-km, which is equivalent to one-third of the carbon emission by a passenger car.									2	0	0	1	0	2	1	15	2210-6707	2210-6715		WOS:000415898200028		J	Ibn-Mohammed, T.								Application of mixed-mode research paradigms to the building sector: A review and case study towards decarbonising the built and natural environment								SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY				35				692	714		10.1016/j.scs.2017.09.027				NOV 2017	2017	The building sector constitute a critical part of the climate change problems, representing the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the sector is central to low-cost climate change mitigation worldwide, making it an integral element in the process of decarbonisation, with the potential to induce effective policy development required to guide the move towards a sustainable low-carbon future. As such, a great deal of cutting-edge and impactful research targeting the sector has been carried out. However, there are fragmentations and inconsistencies in integrating research paradigms to addressing challenges within the sector, with most research adopting either pure qualitative or pure quantitative approaches. Research within the sector encompasses phenomena such as perception, emotions and different behavioural patterns as it pertains to stakeholders, and a number of research have suggested that the use of single-mode research paradigm often fails in exploring these factors. Given the complex nature of the interaction between key actors (i.e. society and the socio-environmental systems) within the sector, the use of mixed-mode research paradigms to address this weakness whilst enhancing research into the sector has become pertinent. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews available paradigms through a case study to illustrate how a research agenda within the sector can be formulated from initiation to fruition using mixed-mode approaches. The paper illustrates the development of a quantitative energy model in the form of a decision support system for building energy retrofit advice. A qualitative evaluation strategy which highlights the social processes that underpins the diffusion of new innovations towards decarbonisation efforts is equally provided. Also discussed are philosophical stances that pertains to research in the sector and the evolution of a research problem stemming from the identification of gap in knowledge in the field and the necessary steps taken towards actualising the research objectives. The concepts illustrated within this paper can be useful for academicians, doctoral research students, early career researchers, policy makers and allied professionals in understanding the key steps required to formulate a research agenda targeting the building sector as well as other related sectors.									3	0	0	0	0	3	1	9	2210-6707	2210-6715		WOS:000415898200059		J	Hamilton, Ian; Summerfield, Alex; Oreszczyn, Tadj; Ruyssevelt, Paul				Hamilton, Ian/O-6756-2019	Hamilton, Ian/0000-0003-2582-2361			Using epidemiological methods in energy and buildings research to achieve carbon emission targets								ENERGY AND BUILDINGS				154				188	197		10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.079				NOV 1 2017	2017	Energy demand reduction from buildings is widely recognised as a key component of greenhouse gas abatement strategies. As governments shift towards large-scale sectoral interventions, a far more robust research and evidence base is needed to support the development, implementation, and on-going evaluation of energy demand policy.The shift to a low carbon built environment will require both a step change in the energy performance of buildings alongside more efficient provision of energy services, and an aggressive decarbonisation of the energy used. Yet the prerequisite data of building stocks needed to support this essential shift in energy performance of buildings are not necessarily available or are inaccessible or incomplete. As more information on building energy use is collected through high frequency sensors and building form analytics become more sophisticated, the analysis methods applied to the myriad and diverse sub-sectors of the building stock 'population' need to be commensurate with the heterogeneity of the building stock.This paper describes and illustrates the basis of the IEA EBC Annex 70: Building Energy Epidemiology, which draws on the health sciences to posit 'energy epidemiology' as a whole-systemapproach for empirical research that provides a methodological framework for building physicists, engineers, social scientists, and economists to engage in cross-disciplinary studies. It makes the case that the development and application of an epidemiological approach to investigating energy demand can advance understanding of the inter-related factors for policy guidance and evaluation and provide insights on the mechanisms that influence energy demand. The aim of the IEA EBC Annex 70 is to work in an international collaboration to identify user needs around energy demand in buildings and to establish best practice methods and harmonized formats for data collection, analysis and modelling.To illustrate this process, we present an example from the UK on the application of energy epidemiological methods to building energy performance in the residential sector. The case study investigates the potential effectiveness of the policy and technical measures proposed by the UK Government.Policy implementation for broad, deep, and urgent reductions in energy demand from the building sector requires a far better understanding of the underlying relationships between people, energy use, buildings and the environment.

Either target requires reaching net zero emissions before the end of the century, which implies a major transformation of the economic system. This study reviews the literature on how policymakers can design climate policies and their nationally determined contributions to reach zero-net emissions before the end of the century in a socially and politically acceptable manner. To get the ambition right, policymakers can use sectoral roadmaps with targets and indicators that track progress toward zero emissions (e.g., regarding renewable power or reforestation). Indeed, monitoring economy-wide emissions-reductions alone would not ensure that short-term action contributes meaningfully to the long-term decarbonization goal. To get the political economy right, climate policies can be designed so that they contribute to nonclimate objectives and create broad coalitions of supporters. For instance, carbon taxes revenues can fund social assistance and infrastructure investment, while reducing tax evasion and informality. To minimize social and economic disruptions and avoid stranded assets, policymakers can also start with a low carbon price level and use complementary policies. Designed at the sector level, complementary policies such as performance standards or feebates for cars, building norms, or moratoriums on new coal power plants can be negotiated in partnership with local stakeholders and trigger a transition to zero carbon that does not directly affect existing polluting capital.

Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world's northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015-2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests.									7	0	0	6	0	7	3	30	2150-8925			WOS:000417330000026		J	Qambrani, Naveed Ahmed; Rahman, Md.

High yield biochar can be produced through torrefaction or slow pyrolysis. The efficiency of biochar production from biomass is highly dependent on the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, type and composition of feedstock, particle size, and reactor conditions. Application of biochar to agriculture may have a significant effect on reducing global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the sequestering of atmospheric carbon into soil. At the same time, biochar can help improve soil health and fertility, and enhance agricultural production. Livestock manure, along with waste-feed residues and bedding materials, is a potential source of biochar. This waste emits significant amounts of GHGs adding to global warming and threatening the environment in other ways. The environmental challenges caused by agricultural and animal-waste disposal can be reduced by recycling the waste using pyrolysis, into biochar, energy, and value-added products. Biochar can act as a sorbent for organic and inorganic contaminants and can efficiently remove these materials from affected waters. Contaminant removal is mainly based on the presence of functional groups and charges on the surface of the biochar. Thus, biochar can help to improve food security by contributing to sustainable production systems and maintaining an eco-friendly environment. This review details the principles and concepts involved in biochar production, the factors that affect biochar quality, as well as the applications of biochar.									67	3	0	28	1	70	76	459	1364-0321			WOS:000410011500020		J	Partey, Samuel T.; Zougmore, Robert B.; Ouedraogo, Mathieu; Thevathasan, Naresh V.

SUSTAINABILITY				9	11					1887	10.3390/su9111887				NOV 2017	2017	In the literature, a lot is discussed about how agroforestry can achieve the mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). However, this may be relatively too broad to assess the trade-offs and synergies of how specific agroforestry technologies or practices achieve the three pillars of CSA. Here, we provide an overview of how improved fallows (an agroforestry technology consisting of planting mainly legume tree/shrub species in rotation with cultivated crops) may achieve the goals of climate-smart agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our review showed that improved fallow systems have real potential to contribute to food security and climate change mitigation and adaptation in SSA. Under proper management, improved fallows can increase maize yields to about 6 t ha(-1), which is comparable to conventional maize yields under fertilization. This is attributed to improved soil fertility and nutrient use efficiency. Although data was generally limited, the growing literature showed that improved fallows increased soil carbon sequestration and reduced greenhouse emissions. Further, as a multiple output land use system, improved fallows may increase fodder availability during dry periods and provide substantial biomass for charcoal production. These livelihood options may become important financial safety nets during off seasons or in the event of crop failures. This notwithstanding, the adoption of improved fallows is mainly in Southern and Eastern Africa, where over 20,000 farmers are now using Sesbania sesban, Tephrosia vogelii, and Cajanus cajan in two-year fallows followed by maize rotations. Land tenure issues, lack of social capital, and improved germplasm and accessions of fallow species have been cited as constraints to scaling up. However, development of seed orchards, nursery development, and the willingness of policy makers to create a policy environment that addresses market failures and alleviates disincentives should improve adoption and future scaling up.									1	0	0	0	0	1	3	22	2071-1050			WOS:000416793400002		J	White, Easton R.

Conventional cotton (Gossypium sp) production technologies had significant effects on the environment and farm profitability in the past. New era transgenic or Bt cotton production technology can be used to simultaneously reduce the environmental footprint and enhance the profitability of cotton production. Information on these two sustainability aspects of transgenic cotton is missing in the scientific literature. Here, we review the potential advantages of insect tolerance Bt insect resistant technology used in hybrid cotton by comparing with the major cereal based rotations in India. Our results suggested that by using this technology, there was significant reduction in pesticide use roughly by 40%, and yield advantages of 30-40%. These resulted in saving on fossil fuels and decreasing CO2 emissions-which are major bonus for climate change mitigation. During the last decade, significant increase in cotton area and production in India is attributed to better returns realized by the farmers, which were largely due to better management practices followed to grow transgenic cotton. Most of the studies conducted in India, concluded that Bt-cotton is more efficient in input use and had a lower environmental impact quotient, which indicates less damage to the environment than non-Bt-cotton. However, Btcotton based cropping systems have less profitability and energy efficiency in comparison to the major cereal based rotations in India due to lesser productivity potential of cotton crop particularly in rain-fed ecosystems. This was mainly attributed to the lesser dissemination of proven energy-efficient research technologies to the farmer's fields. Although, Bt-cotton can contribute to a "sustainable intensification" strategy favoured by many science academies worldwide, which allows productivity/production to be increased in the current crop land, thereby saving forests and biodiversity.									2	0	0	1	0	2	2	20	0019-5022			WOS:000417034700001		J	Zhou, Qian; Yabar, Helmut; Mizunoya, Takeshi; Higano, Yoshiro				/C-5136-2017	/0000-0003-0886-5685; Yabar, Helmut/0000-0002-7665-1884			Evaluation of Integrated Air Pollution and Climate Change Policies: Case Study in the Thermal Power Sector in Chongqing City, China								SUSTAINABILITY				9	10					1741	10.3390/su9101741				OCT 2017	2017	The cost of environmental degradation has already had a dramatic impact on the Chinese economy. In order to curb these trends, the government of China has introduced stricter regulations. With this in mind, it is important to quantify the potential co-benefits of introducing air pollution and climate change mitigation policies. This study proposes relevant scenarios ranging from the current trends (baseline) to the introduction of different policies in the thermal power sector, including different carbon tax rates, technology innovation promotion, and technology cost reduction methods. We aim to comparatively evaluate the impact of the proposed policies within the thermal sector and within the entire socio-economic system. To this end, we used a dynamic input-output (I-O) model, into which high-efficiency technologies were incorporated as new thermal power industries in order to estimate policy impact during the time period 2010-2025. The results of this study demonstrated that the introduction of one or more of the following policies: carbon taxes, subsidies, technology innovation, and technology cost reduction, has no notable impact on the environment or the economy without the implementation of environment regulations. In contrast, the strong support of a government subsidy coupled with strict environmental regulations will promote technological innovation, for example through the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) and the integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Our study also showed that the reduction of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as well as energy consumption would curb economic development to a certain extent. Taking this into consideration, innovation must also be promoted in other economic sectors. This research provides a strong reference for policy-makers to identify effective polices under different types of environmental regulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	15	2071-1050			WOS:000414896200072		J	Maienza, Anita; Baronti, Silvia; Cincinelli, Alessandra; Martellini, Tania; Grisolia, Antonio; Miglietta, Franco; Renella, Giancarlo; Stazi, Silvia Rita; Vaccari, Francesco Primo; Genesio, Lorenzo				Vaccari, Francesco Primo/C-2123-2009; Miglietta, Franco/B-6137-2008; Genesio, Lorenzo/B-1218-2012; Baronti, Silvia/D-2828-2011; stazi, silvia rita/G-9237-2011; Baronti, Silvia/AAD-5339-2019; Maienza, ANITA/Q-1645-2018	Vaccari, Francesco Primo/0000-0002-5253-2135; Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143; Genesio, Lorenzo/0000-0001-9265-886X; Baronti, Silvia/0000-0002-0986-0723; stazi, silvia rita/0000-0001-6827-3062; Baronti, Silvia/0000-0002-0986-0723; Maienza, ANITA/0000-0001-8424-7622; Martellini, Tania/0000-0001-6803-1928			Biochar improves the fertility of a Mediterranean vineyard without toxic impact on the microbial community								AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT				37	5					UNSP 47	10.1007/s13593-017-0458-2				OCT 2017	2017	Incorporation of biochar into agricultural soils has been repeatedly proposed as an effective strategy to mitigate climate change with beneficial effects on soil properties and crop production. Results from previous field experiments showed that, when applied to vineyards, biochar amendment increased yield without a negative impact on grape quality, decreasing water stress during droughts and improving soil physical and chemical properties. Despite those positive impacts, the long-term effects of biochar treatment on soil fertility and ecological toxicity have seldom been studied at a real farm scale. We investigated the effects of biochar amendment on vineyard soil subjected to a single and a repeated biochar application focusing on total heavy metal concentration and availability, concentration and persistence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), soil toxicity, and soil microbial community structure over a 5-year period. Our results showed that a longer term biochar application in a vineyard has no impact on soil microorganisms and does not retain toxic compounds (PAH and heavy metals). For the first time in biochar research, we investigate the biochar effect on a perennial crop and correlate the PAH retention with soil microbiota. Our research demonstrates that biochar application in a Mediterranean vineyard does not have a negative impact on soil ecology, reinforcing the perception that biochar is a sustainable option at farm scale, meeting the needs of agronomy and climate change mitigation.									3	0	0	3	0	3	0	48	1774-0746	1773-0155		WOS:000413695000003		J	Grafton, R.

We define the concept of generalized Kant-Nash equilibrium which encompasses the Nash equilibrium, the Kantian equilibrium and the Kant-Nash equilibrium as special cases. We show the existence and uniqueness of a Kant-Nash equilibrium in a static game of climate change mitigation, and derive its properties. In a dynamic setting, we analyze a differential game of climate change mitigation in the presence of both types of agents, and compare their Markov emission strategies. For both the static model and the dynamic model, as the population share of Kantians increases, the quality of the environment improves, and both types of agents are better off.

However, sustainability of perovskite cells has been questioned due to application of lead in the perovskite layer which may result in the release of lead to the environment and the human population. In this study, substance flow analysis was used to quantify potential lead emissions from production, use and end of life of perovskite in tandem solar cells. Lead emissions were translated into human toxicity and ecotoxicity impacts using life cycle assessment. Climate change impacts from electricity for perovskite production were also taken into account. These impacts are compared to the ones of the grid electricity that would otherwise have been used. Climate change and toxicity benefits and burdens are weighted using shadow prices. Our results show that environmental benefits from avoided grid electricity exceed environmental burdens from using perovskite based cells for climate change as well as for toxicity. We conclude that perovskite based cells can contribute to transition to renewable energy sources. Further research into lead encapsulation measures and worker exposure are recommended.

The application of new GHG mitigation technologies are essential to promote a cleaner environment. This is critical since not all new technologies are environmentally friendly. To understand whether and to what extent such technologies mitigate GHG, this survey study was conducted to measure the amount of the dynamic energy consumption and productivity growth of pomegranate production during 2009-2015 in the Fars province, Southwest Iran. Dynamic DEA models were employed for the efficiency analyses. The data were gathered from pomegranate gardeners through questionnaires by face-to-face interviews. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were tested and confirmed respectively through a pilot study and Cronbach's alpha. Using simple random sampling method, 55 pomegranate gardeners were chosen for the survey. The dynamic DEA revealed that our gardeners had the best performance in 2013, 2014 and 2015. The average energy consumption was 42,230 MJ/ha to produce 17,300 kg/ha pomegranate. The highest output-input energy ratio was also obtained in 2013, 2014 and 2015 of 1.013. The most efficient gardeners consumed more renewable energy especially in the form of farm yard manure. Accordingly, the gardeners with the least efficiency should enhance pomegranate yield and reduce the extra energy inputs of around 10,000 kg/ha (58% of average) and 25,000 MJ/ha (59% of the average), respectively. Malmquist index showed that the best efficient gardeners had annual positive technology change of 8.3%. Statistical analyses confirmed that each positive percentage of technology change reduces the energy input by 710 times and CO2 emission mitigation by 634 times meaning that the gardeners used some energy efficient technologies that lead to lower GHG emissions. The technology change can be predicted by some of the socio-demographic attributes of the gardeners such as farming experience, net income and participating in extensional classes. The study concludes that highly efficient pomegranate production besides new technology use policies would ultimately contribute to the robust climate change mitigation from this sector.

Impacts will stem both from the supply sidethrough the mitigation of greenhouse gasesand from the demand sidethrough adaptive responses to a changing environment. Here we provide evidence of a polarization of both peak load and overall electricity consumption under future warming for the worlds third-largest electricity marketthe 35 countries of Europe. We statistically estimate country-level doseresponse functions between daily peak/total electricity load and ambient temperature for the period 2006-2012. After removing the impact of nontemperature confounders and normalizing the residual load data for each country, we estimate a common doseresponse function, which we use to compute national electricity loads for temperatures that lie outside each countrys currently observed temperature range. To this end, we impose end-of-century climate on todays European economies following three different greenhouse-gas concentration trajectories, ranging from ambitious climate-change mitigationin line with the Paris agreementto unabated climate change. We find significant increases in average daily peak load and overall electricity consumption in southern and western Europe (similar to 3 to similar to 7% for Portugal and Spain) and significant decreases in northern Europe (similar to-6 to similar to-2% for Sweden and Norway). While the projected effect on European total consumption is nearly zero, the significant polarization and seasonal shifts in peak demand and consumption have important ramifications for the location of costly peak-generating capacity, transmission infrastructure, and the design of energy-efficiency policy and storage capacity.									16	1	0	4	0	16	0	6	0027-8424			WOS:000411157100010	28847939	J	Sousa, Gustavo; Jones, Benjamin M.; Mirzaei, Parham A.; Robinson, Darren					Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-5606-9379			A review and critique of UK housing stock energy models, modelling approaches and data sources								ENERGY AND BUILDINGS				151				66	80		10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.06.043				SEP 15 2017	2017	The UK housing stock is responsible for some 27% of national energy demand and associated carbon dioxide emissions. 80% of this energy demand is due to heating (60%) and domestic hot water (20%), the former reflecting the poor average thermal integrity of the envelope of the homes comprising this stock. To support the formulation of policies and strategies to decarbonise the UK housing stock, a large number of increasingly sophisticated Housing Stock Energy Models (HSEMs) have been developed throughout the past 25 years. After describing the sources of data and the spatio-temporal granularity with which these data are available to represent this stock, as well as the physical and social phenomena that are modelled and the range of strategies employed to do so, this paper evaluates the 29 HSEMs that have been developed and deployed in the UK. In this we consider the models' predictive accuracy, predictive sensitivity to design parameters, versatility, computational efficiency, the reproducibility of predictions and software usability as well as the models' transparency (how open they are) and modularity. We also discuss their comprehensiveness. From this evaluation, we conclude that current HSEMs are lacking in transparency and modularity, they are limited in their scope and employ simplistic models that limit their utility; in particular, relating to the modelling of heat flow and in the modelling of household behaviours relating to investment decisions and energy using practices. There is a need for an open-source and modular dynamic housing stock energy modelling platform that addresses current limitations, can be readily updated as new (e.g. housing survey) calibration data is released and be readily extended by the modelling community at large: improving upon the "utilisation of scarce developmental resources. This would represent a considerable step forward in the formulation of housing stock decarbonisation policy that is informed by sound evidence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the present study aims for the estimation of energy efficiency and extent of greenhouse gas reduction after benchmarking of inefficient farms in off-season tomato in Punjab province of Pakistan. Primary data were collected from 70 farmers with simple random sampling. By using data envelopment analysis, the average value of technical, pure technical and scale efficiency was 0.80, 0.92 and 0.87, respectively while increasing, constant and decreasing return to scale was observed in 33, 26 and 11 farmers, respectively. Total input energy was reduced by 12,688.91 MJ ha(-1) (13.89%) if inefficient farms used the energy inputs according to recommendations or benchmarking. A major portion of energy saving comes from fertilizers (68.79%) followed by diesel (15.70%), chemicals (5.91%), machinery (4.37%) and water (4.00%). Total greenhouse gases reduction was 499.17 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) (14.57%) as a result of improvement in energy efficiency or benchmarking of inefficient farms. Agricultural extension staff should visit the vegetable farms on regular basis and give necessary information about efficient utilization of energy inputs. The government should create awareness about the optimum use of input through seminars and pamphlets.									1	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	2287-6316	2287-6324		WOS:000429996700001		J	Packalen, Tuula; Karkkainen, Leena; Toppinen, Anne					Toppinen, Anne/0000-0003-0910-1505			The future operating environment of the Finnish sawmill industry in an era of climate change mitigation policies								FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS				82		SI		30	40		10.1016/j.forpol.2016.09.017				SEP 2017	2017	Sawnwood and its further-processed products play an important role in the mitigation of climate change; sawnwood, as well as its by-products from production processes, such as raw material (bark, chips, dust) for energy products (e.g. pellets, heating power), can substitute for other raw materials with higher carbon footprints. In this study, we integrate various foresight methods in analysing the future of the sawmilling industry in Finland. According to the results, climate change mitigation policies impact firstly through increasing energy costs and secondly through emerging energy products. The greatest uncertainties are related to the price of energy and the competitive situation of wood as a potential source of energy, both regulated heavily by EU- and national level policies. In addition, the future development of biorefineries was regarded as a potential driver of change: the increasing demand for pulpwood would increase competition for the raw materials. From a managerial perspective, the Finnish sawmilling industry should thus consider adoption of new business models for joint production of wood, chips, and energy for heat and power. For the policymakers our study illustrates how important it is to take into account the causal effects on profitability determinants when designing policy measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the technology targets specified in the technology roadmap, including the energy density, cost, power density, and durability, are reviewed and compared with previous projections from other countries. It is found that China's pre-2020 targets are generally in line with previous projections. The 20202030 targets are quite ambitious and aggressive. If the battery technologies evolve as projected, electric vehicles will have similar market competitiveness with conventional vehicles by around 2020, implying a mass market penetration of electric vehicles. This will impose very broad impacts on China's urban environment, oil security, rare metal security, climate change mitigation and charging infrastructure deployment. On the other hand, it should be fully noted that the technology roadmap is more market demand-oriented than technology capacity oriented. The technology uncertainty issues did not receive adequate emphasis in the technology roadmap, which might result in over-optimism in the future of battery technologies and electric vehicle market penetration.									8	2	0	1	0	9	4	19	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000406725800035		J	Elum, Z.

The greater awareness of the need to mitigate climate variability has brought about intense focus on the adverse impacts of fossil-fuel based energy on the environment. Being the single largest source of carbon emissions, energy supply has attracted much attention and more so that, climate change impacts extend beyond national boundaries. Since energy use is sine qua non to economic development, scientists have reiterated the necessity of developing and utilising renewable energy. Although, past and present CO2 emissions have and are majorly caused by industrialized countries, it is envisaged that future GHGs emissions would be mostly from developing countries as they industrialize. Renewable energy sources that include biomass, hydroelectric, wind, solar and hydrothermal systems, are carbon-neutral, releasing relatively no emissions. This paper discusses the initiatives associated with the provision of renewable energy to the energy mix in Nigeria as an indication of the country's commitment to adopt a sustainable development strategy in shaping the economy. It reviews the literature and employs a discourse analysis to examine the limited use of renewable energy sources in Nigeria and the factors prevailing against their development. The paper concludes by identifying social and political obstacles as most significant roadblocks towards rapid implementation of a green economy through the deployment of renewable energy for sustainable development.									14	0	0	3	0	14	2	40	1364-0321			WOS:000403381300008		J	Morrison, Tiffany H.; Adger, W.

The potential of polycentric governance for promoting both climate mitigation and adaptation is well established. Yet, dominant conceptualizations of polycentric governance pay scant attention to how power dynamics affect the structure and the outcomes of climate action. We review emerging evidence on power within polycentric and distributed governance across the climate, forestry, marine, coastal, urban, and water sectors, and relate them to established positions on power within research on federalism, decentralization, international relations, and networked governance. We develop a typology of design, pragmatic, and framing power that focuses on how and in whose interests power is mobilized to achieve outcomes. We propose that the conceptual model helps to explain power dynamics across different sectors and across both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Significant research challenges arising from the analysis include the measurement and monitoring of the outcomes of power asymmetries over time. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The environment (e.g., soils and climate) and management influence agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and the potential to reduce emissions. For agriculture to contribute to greenhouse gas abatement in the long term, it is important to identify low-cost mitigation actions that farmers can adopt. It is hypothesized that greenhouse gas abatement potential and the associated costs will differ substantially between environments in Australia. Seven alternative management scenarios were identified as both suitable for adoption across different grain growing environments in Australia and potentially able to provide greenhouse gas abatement. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator was used to simulate these alternative management scenarios over a 25-year period and analyze the potential for Australian grain farmers, across contrasting environments, to increase soil organic carbon stocks and/or reduce nitrous oxide emissions. This analysis was paired with a whole-farm economic analysis to determine the implications of the different greenhouse gas abatement scenarios on farm profitability. Results from case studies in Australia's three main grain growing regions demonstrate that significant heterogeneity exists in the biophysical potential and costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across locations. The maximum predicted abatement potential for the case study sites varied from 0.34 to 2.03 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare per year. In most simulations, greenhouse gas abatement came at a cost to farmers ranging from 0.11 Australian dollars (AUD) to more than 300 AUD per metric ton of abated carbon dioxide equivalent. This is the first study to explore the costs of mitigation including multiple greenhouse gases and grain farming case studies across Australia. These findings can inform the future development of effective climate change mitigation policies, which frequently use national default values in their design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	3	12	1774-0746	1773-0155		WOS:000408339800006		J	Li, Wei; Jia, Zhijie				Jia, Zhijie/E-7122-2017	Jia, Zhijie/0000-0003-4569-5558			Carbon tax, emission trading, or the mixed policy: which is the most effective strategy for climate change mitigation in China?

Under this strategy, a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to analyze the economy, energy, and environment impact of CO2 emission reduction policy based on 17 scenarios in China: carbon tax, emission trading scheme (ETS), and the mixed policy in different price level, in order to find out which kind of emission reduction strategy is more feasible. The results show that CO2 emission in 2030 will be reduced with the implementation of tax, ETS and mixed policy, by 10-13 %, 12-14 %, and 18-28 %, respectively. From 2016 to 2030, China can reduce 18,338-24,156 Mt CO2 through the implementation of mixed policy. Furthermore, relative to single policy, mixed policy has stronger effects on primary energy consumption cut, by 738-1124 Mtoe or 18-28 %, which will make CO2 emissions reach a peak before 2030 and the peak emission is not greater than 12 billion tons which is in line with the reduction demand in China. Thus, the mixed policy is the most effective strategy so that mixed policy is recommended to parties included in Annex I in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol and other countries with large potential of emission reduction, while ETS is suggested to countries with low carbon emissions per capita which can balance economic development and CO2 mitigation.									16	0	0	2	0	16	8	97	1381-2386	1573-1596		WOS:000405606900007		J	Weldu, Yemane W.								Life cycle human health and ecosystem quality implication of biomass-based strategies to climate change mitigation								RENEWABLE ENERGY				108				11	18		10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.046				AUG 2017	2017	Exposure to air pollution claimed the lives of about seven million people worldwide in 2010, largely from combustion of solid biomass fuels. Bioenergy is an alternative renewable source which can mitigate a climate change. Little is known about the human health and ecosystem effects of bioenergy, mainly in the electricity sector. This research applied a life cycle assessment approach to examine the human health and ecosystem effects of four bioenergy pathways: direct combustion of wood biomass, direct combustion of forest residue, direct combustion of pellets, and biomass integrated gasification and combined cycle (BIGCC). All pathways showed some variability of impacts; therefore, no single bioenergy pathway was the best absolute option. With the exception of the slightly higher human health impact, BIGCC has the least impact for all impact categories. However, all bioenergy systems implied lower ecosystem impact but higher human health impact as compared to climate change impact. Electricity generation from wood-biomass would improve the environmental sustainability of Alberta's electricity grid system because it reduces the human health and ecosystem impacts, as compared to the existing electricity production mix of the province.

Some of it is due to energy consumption inside buildings, which depends on building use and human behaviour, both of which are very heterogeneous in most urban areas. Urban canopy parametrisations (UCP), such as the Town Energy Balance (TEB), parametrise the effect of the buildings on the urban surface energy balance. They contain a simple building energy model. However, the variety of building use and human behaviour at grid point scale has not yet been represented in state of the art UCPs. In this study, we describe how we enhance the Town Energy Balance in order to take fractional building use and human behaviour into account. We describe how we parametrise different behaviours and initialise the model for applications in France. We evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of the simulated building energy consumption for the city of Toulouse. We show that a more detailed description of building use and human behaviour enhances the simulation results. The model developments lay the groundwork for simulations of coupled urban climate and building energy consumption which are relevant for both the urban climate and the climate change mitigation and adaptation communities.									5	0	0	1	0	5	1	16	1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000406349600001		J	Liang, Yunfeng; Tsuji, Shinya; Jia, Jihui; Tsuji, Takeshi; Matsuoka, Toshifumi				Tsuji, Takeshi/N-3024-2019; Tsuji, Takeshi/I-5679-2014; Jia, Jihui/O-8848-2019; Jia, Jihui/F-9622-2017	Tsuji, Takeshi/0000-0003-0951-4596; Tsuji, Takeshi/0000-0003-0951-4596; Jia, Jihui/0000-0002-4386-9027			Modeling CO2-Water-Mineral Wettability and Mineralization for Carbon Geosequestration								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				50	7			1530	1540		10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00049				JUL 2017	2017	Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is an important climate change mitigation option along with improved energy efficiency, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. CO2 geosequestration, that is, to store CO2 under the subsurface of Earth, is feasible because the world's sedimentary basins have high capacity and are often located in the same region of the world as emission sources. How CO2 interacts with the connate water and minerals is the focus of this Account. There are four trapping mechanisms that keep CO2 in the pores of subsurface rocks: (1) structural trapping, (2) residual trapping, (3) dissolution trapping, and (4) mineral trapping. The first two are dominated by capillary action, where wettability controls CO2 and water two-phase flow in porous media. We review state-of-the-art studies on CO2/water/mineral wettability, which was found to depend on pressure and temperature conditions, salt concentration in aqueous solutions, mineral surface chemistry, and geometry. We then review some recent advances in mineral trapping.First, we show that it is possible to reproduce the CO2/water/mineral wettability at a wide range of pressures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As the pressure increases, CO2 gas transforms into a supercritical fluid or liquid at similar to 7.4 MPa. depending on the environmental temperature. This transition leads to a substantial decrease of the interfacial tension between CO2 and reservoir brine (or pure water). However, the wettability of CO2/water/rock systems depends on the type of rock surface. Recently, we investigated the contact angle of CO2/water/silica systems with two different silica surfaces using MD simulations. We found that contact angle increased with pressure for the hydrophobic (siloxane) surface while it was almost constant for the hydrophilic (silanol) surface, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, we found that the CO2 thin films at the CO2 hydrophilic silica and CO2-H2O interfaces displayed a linear correlation, which can in turn explain the constant contact angle on the hydrophilic silica surface. In view of the literature and our study results, a few recommendations seem necessary to construct a molecular system suitable to study wettability with MD simulations. Future work should be conducted to determine the influence of brine salinity on the wettability of minerals with high cation exchange capacity.Mineral trapping is believed to be an extremely slow process, likely taking thousands of years. However, a recent pilot study demonstrated that CO2 mineralization occurs within 2 years in highly reactive basalt reservoirs. A first-principles MD study has also shown that carbonation reactions occur rapidly at the surface oxygen sites of a reactive mineral. We observed carbonate ions on both a newly cleaved quartz surface (without hydrolysis), and a basalt andesine surface after hydrolysis in a CO2-rich environment. Future work should consider the influence of water, gas impurities, and mineral cation type on carbonation.									15	0	0	0	0	15	8	54	0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000406085500005	28661135	J	Sample, V.

It is estimated that forest regeneration on these lands could result in an additional terrestrial sequestration of 48.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) annually. Analysis across a range of seven site productivity classes indicates that approximately 58% of the total area is productive timberland, defined as capable of producing merchantable volume of >= 1.4 m(2)/ha/year. It is estimated that regeneration of just the productive timberland portion of the total could produce an additional 44.4 million metric tons of CO(2)e annually in carbon sequestration. On National Forest System lands, more than 50% of the total potential carbon sequestration benefit from regenerating nonstocked lands could be achieved by reforesting just the top 30% of these lands in the moderate-to-high site productivity classes. On private lands, more than 70% of the total potential carbon benefit can be achieved by regenerating the most productive 30%.									8	0	0	6	0	8	3	8	0022-1201	1938-3746		WOS:000406737300010		J	Cho, Hyun-Tae; Kwon, Suk-Hyun; Han, Jung-Geun								Estimation of Environmental Load of Geotechnical Structure using Multiple Regression Analysis								KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				21	5			1581	1586		10.1007/s12205-017-0419-y				JUL 2017	2017	With the increased global interest in greenhouse gas reduction, many countries around the world have been making a range of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Ministry of Environment suggested a goal of 37% reduction relative to the expected greenhouse gas 'business as usual' (BAU) for all industries; thus, greenhouse gas reduction in the construction industry is also inevitable. To reduce greenhouse gas, the effects of a construction project on the environment need to be minimized, and an integrated evaluation that involves various kinds of environmental pollution (e.g., resource usage, water, air, and soil) as well as greenhouse gas is required. Therefore, in this study, for a reasonable and objectively valid evaluation of the environment-friendliness of a tunnel facility (a geotechnical structure), a life cycle assessment was performed based on existing cases following the ISO 14040 series standard. The purpose of this study is to suggest an environmental load evaluation technique that statistically analyzes the effects of work processes, input materials, and energy sources during tunnel work by suggesting the estimation equation for 8 impact categories that affect environmental load.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	8	1226-7988	1976-3808		WOS:000404144000008		J	Pelletier, Johanne; Siampale, Abel; Legendre, Pierre; Jantz, Patrick; Laporte, Nadine T.; Goetz, Scott J.

We assessed the human and natural controls over aboveground tree biomass density in African dry tropical forests, using Zambia's first nationwide forest inventory. We identified predictors that best explain the variation in biomass density, contrasted anthropogenic and natural sites at different spatial scales, and compared sites with different stand structure characteristics and species composition. In addition, we evaluated the effects of different management and conservation practices on biomass density. Variation in biomass density was mostly determined by biotic processes, linked with both species richness and dominance (evenness), and to a lesser extent, by land use, environmental controls, and spatial structure. Biomass density was negatively associated with tree species evenness and positively associated with species richness for both natural and human-modified sites. Human influence variables (including distance to roads, distance to town, fire occurrence, and the population on site) did not explain substantial variation in biomass density in comparison to biodiversity variables. The relationship of human activities to biomass density in managed sites appears to be mediated by effects on species diversity and stand structure characteristics, with lower values in human-modified sites for all metrics tested. Small contrasts in carbon density between human-modified and natural forest sites signal the potential to maintain carbon in the landscape inside but also outside forestlands in this region. Biodiversity is positively related to biomass density in both human and natural sites, demonstrating potential synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This is the first evidence of positive outcomes of protected areas and participatory forest management on carbon storage at national scale in Zambia. This research shows that understanding controls over biomass density can provide policy relevant inputs for carbon management and on ecological processes affecting carbon storage.									2	0	0	1	0	2	0	22	1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000405174300014	28374945	J	Fidel, Rivka B.; Laird, David A.; Parkin, Timothy B.								Impact of six lignocellulosic biochars on C and N dynamics of two contrasting soils								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY				9	7			1279	1291		10.1111/gcbb.12414				JUL 2017	2017	Both soil and biochar properties are known to influence greenhouse gas emissions from biochar-amended soils, but poor understanding of underlying mechanisms challenges prediction and modeling. Here, we examine the effect of six lignocellulosic biochars produced from the pyrolysis of corn stover and wood feedstocks on CO2 and N2O emissions from soils collected from two bioenergy cropping systems. Effects of biochar on total accumulated CO2-C emissions were minimal (<0.45 mg C g(-1) soil; <10% of biochar C), consistent with mineralization and hydrolysis of small labile organic and inorganic C fractions in the studied biochars. Comparisons of soil CO2 emissions with emissions from microbially inoculated quartz-biochar mixtures ('quartz controls') provide evidence of soil and biochar-specific negative priming. Five of six biochar amendments suppressed N2O emissions from at least one soil, and the magnitude of N2O emissions suppression varied with respect to both biochar and soil types. Biochar amendments consistently decreased final soil NO3- concentrations, while contrasting effects on pH, NH4+, and DOC highlighted the potential for formation of anaerobic microsites in biochar-amended soils and consequential shifts in the soil redox environment. Thus, results implicated both reduced substrate availability and redox shifts as potential factors contributing to N2O emission suppression. More research is needed to confirm these mechanisms, but overall our results suggest that soil biochar amendments commonly reduce N2O emissions and have little effect on CO2 emissions beyond the mineralization and/or hydrolysis of labile biochar C fractions. Considering the large C credit for the biochar C, we conclude that biochar amendments can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the climate change mitigation potential of bioenergy cropping systems.									8	0	0	4	0	8	2	41	1757-1693	1757-1707		WOS:000403225800009		J	Schmidt, Tobias S.; Matsuo, Tyeler; Michaelowa, Axel								Renewable energy policy as an enabler of fossil fuel subsidy reform?

While the plunge in international fuel prices has increased the political will to introduce fossil fuel subsidy reforms, recently introduced reforms may risk backsliding when fuel prices rebound particularly if they fail to address the underlying mechanisms that create demand for low fossil fuel prices. Extant literature has mostly focused on the consequences of fossil fuel subsidies, including their economic or environmental impact, and the social contract that make their reform difficult. In this paper, we complement the extant literature with a socio-technical perspective of fossil fuel subsidies to explore the systemic mechanisms that often keep subsidies in place and how these mechanisms can be weakened. Specifically, in case studies of the electricity sectors in South Africa and Tunisia, we trace the socio-technical foundations of their fossil fuel subsidy regimes and the potential of renewable energy policy in disrupting this regime We discuss the relevance of our results for national policymakers wishing to implement and international actors wishing to support fossil fuel subsidy reform. In particular, we highlight that the socio-technical perspective of fossil fuel subsidies offers new intervention points for subsidy reform and that policy designs and assistance should strengthen technologies and actors that are most likely to destabilize the fossil fuel subsidy regime.									12	0	0	1	0	12	1	10	0959-3780	1872-9495		WOS:000411912800009		J	Rode, David C.; Fischbeck, Paul S.; Paez, Antonio R.

While policy analyses often invoke assumptions of power plant book life, relatively little analysis has focused on the physical life of power-generating assets. The average age of the U.S. generator fleet has increased significantly over time despite continued investment, in part because more recent investment has tended to focus on shorter-lived assets. This may be due in part to risk-averse power sector investors and lenders responding rationally to regulatory uncertainty in a deregulated market environment. Power plant retirement trends suggest that the pace of retirements will increase significantly in the decade after 2030 for most reasonable estimates of physical life. These capital investment trends have important consequences for carbon policy and highlight the importance of including consideration of the longer term particularly when evaluating more significant decarbonization policies.									7	0	0	0	0	7	0	2	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000402343600023		J	Kragt, Marit E.; Dumbrell, Nikki P.; Blackrnore, Louise				Kragt, Marit E./D-3185-2011	Kragt, Marit E./0000-0001-6847-4817; Dumbrell, Nikki/0000-0001-8876-8257; Blackmore, Louise/0000-0002-0636-7466			Motivations and barriers for Western Australian broad-acre farmers to adopt carbon farming								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY				73				115	123		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.009				JUL 2017	2017	Carbon farming policies aim to contribute to climate change mitigation, but their success strongly depends on whether landholders actually adopt desired practices or participate in offered programs. The Australian Government's Carbon Fanning Initiative and Emissions Reduction Fund policies were designed to incentivise the adoption of carbon farming practices. Although these policies have been active since December 2011, farmer engagement has been limited, and net emissions reductions low as a result. We surveyed broad-acre farmers in the Western Australian wheatbelt to explore their drivers and barriers to adopting carbon farming practices and participating in carbon fanning policy programs. Drivers of adoption included knowledge and perception of co-benefits (for yield, productivity, and the environment), knowing another adopter, and believing that changes to farm management are an appropriate method to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Barriers to adoption included lack of information, uncertainty and costs. The key barrier to participation was policy and political uncertainty. The determinants of adoption and participation that we identify in our study offer important insights into how to best ensure the success of Australia's land sector-based climate change policies. We conclude that, to increase landholder engagement, the co-benefits and climate change benefits of carbon farming practices must be actively promoted, and additional information is needed about the costs associated with adoption. Information diffusion is best achieved if it actively leverages landholder social networks. Finally, our results indicate that landholder buy-in to carbon farming could be greatly enhanced by achieving more continuity in Australian climate change policies and politics.									9	0	0	3	0	9	0	22	1462-9011	1873-6416		WOS:000401880600014		J	Drabo, Alassane								Climate change mitigation and agricultural development models: Primary commodity exports or local consumption production?								ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS				137				110	125		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.03.014				JUL 2017	2017	The increasing demand for agricultural products partly due to the high population growth requires agriculture to struggle for productivity improvement. However, productivity search is constrained by environmental preoccupations, raising the question of agricultural development models to be adopted to increase productivity while limiting environmental consequences. This paper examines the role of market orientation by assessing the effect of agricultural commodity export on greenhouse gas emissions relatively to local market oriented agricultural production model. Using panel data from 1986 to 2010 for 136 countries around the world, and accurate instrumental variables technique, the findings suggest that the proportion of primary commodity export in agricultural production increases greenhouse gas emissions. These results are robust to different sources of agricultural export and environmental data, and to the inclusion of additional control variables. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We are losing the climate change mitigation challenge; Is it too late to recover?								MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY				4						e4	10.1557/mre.2017.5				JUN 6 2017	2017	The status of the climate change mitigation challenge is analyzed and summarized. Pressures spawned by industrialization and population growth have driven unsustainable growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yielding global warming. Such warming has accelerated over the last three years and for 2016 was 1.3 degrees C over pre-industrial levels. Serious climate change induced impacts have already occurred and more serious ones are projected. The recent UN Paris COP agreement is only a small step toward meaningful mitigation. It will only slow emission growth and will not lead to near term aggressive annual emission decreases, which are needed to avoid warming of 2 degrees C or more. We are losing the battle to protect the planet from unacceptable climate change impacts. To minimize the impacts, the following is needed: more aggressive communication of the seriousness of the problem to national leaders and the public, a serious adaptation program, a dramatically expanded RD&D program to accelerate the development of low cost low C technologies, with a focus on potentially transformational technologies, and a serious commitment to peak global emissions as soon as possible and drastically reduce such emissions annually from that point on. A global agreement to set a price on carbon (C) could be effective in helping to achieve such an aggressive emission reduction trajectory.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	2329-2229	2329-2237		WOS:000427824100001		J	Matthes, Felix Christian								Energy transition in Germany: a case study on a policy-driven structural change of the energy system								EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW				14	1			141	169		10.1007/s40844-016-0066-x				JUN 2017	2017	The German energy transition ("Energiewende''), i.e., shifting the basis of the energy system from fossil and nuclear fuels to renewable energy constitutes a policy-driven structural change of the energy systems. The fundamental political decisions on nuclear phase-out and the deep decarbonisation of the energy system were based on specific risk considerations in German society, formed by political and learning processes over more than two decades, including the experiences made with the roll-out of renewable energies from 1990 to 2010 that created significant technology optimism in this field. The major challenges for the energy transition do not arise from technological issues or the system costs of a renewables-based system if the once-only investments in innovation are taken into account (that contributed significantly to the massive cost decrease of wind and solar energy at global level). Structural challenges arise first from the dominance of variable renewable energies, which changes generation patterns and shifts cost structures to high shares of capital and low or even zero marginal costs. This triggers the need for restructured power market design that enables price-based system coordination as well as the payback of investments in a low marginal cost environment and re-adjusts the cost allocation among the different consumer groups. Second, the increasing diversity in the power system brings in a broad range of new players and new economic appraisals (selfgeneration, etc.) that also requires-beyond new dimensions of coordinationstructural changes in the regulatory framework. Third, the spatial patterns of the electricity system necessitate large-scale structural changes in the network infrastructures, which demand a sensitive reflection of public acceptance and network regulation approaches. A successful energy transition beyond its present stage requires stringent and holistic policy approaches that are based on four pillars: paving the way for clean energy, designing the exit game for the high-carbon assets, triggering the network infrastructures and making innovation work in time.									6	0	0	0	0	6	0	21	1349-4961	2188-2096		WOS:000405866500009		J	Diallo, Thierno; Cantoreggi, Nicola; Simos, Jean; Christie, Derek P.

We have chosen as a case study greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction policies chosen by the city of Geneva. The methodological approach consists in analysing EIA, SEA, SA and HIA conducted on three projects in three topic areas: urban planning, heating and transportation. These projects are: a complex urbanisation plan in an urban neighbourhood in Geneva (the Gare des Eaux-Vives project), a sustainable transportation plan for a central district in Geneva (the St-Gervais transportation project) and a strategy to encourage the City's employees to use sustainable transport for local business travel. The results show some shortcomings in the consideration of health in SEA, EIA and SA. This work highlights a narrow vision of health in SEA and EIA, limiting itself to a review of the effects of projects on the determinants of the physical environment as required by the legislation relating to these tools. EIA does not require the integration of the health dimension. As for SA, our research found that health is treated much more superficially than in HIA and primarily through the analysis of health and safety' criteria. It appears from this work that HIA is the tool which provides the most elaborate assessment, compared to SA, SEA or EIA, of the consequences for health of the GHG reduction policies chosen by the local decision-makers of a city. However, our study suggests that the HIA community should identify the situations in which HIA should be carried out and in which cases it is better to include health issues within an integrated analysis.									4	0	0	0	0	4	4	26	1757-9759	1757-9767		WOS:000404418800002	28482734	J	Anderton, Karen								Understanding the role of regional influence and innovation in EU policymaking: Bavaria and Cars and CO2								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE				35	4	SI		640	660		10.1177/2399654417697702				JUN 2017	2017	This article investigates the development and implementation of the EU Cars and CO2 Regulation.

Utilising notions from institutional interplay, social-political and cross-disciplinary governance, it demonstrates the complexities in multi-level, multi-actor governance by exploring the interactions between diverse stakeholders and the tensions between multi-level policy mixes. Decarbonisation is a pressing problem to which there are high expectations to find solutions, but certain institutional challenges are hindering progress toward achieving this aim. Fostering innovation is a priority for the Bavarian government, ensuring that the auto-industry continues to deliver economic prosperity and a competitive edge in technological development.

Mitigation benefits through the use of forest products are affected by product life cycles, which determine the duration of carbon storage in wood products and substitution benefits where emissions are avoided using wood products instead of other emissions-intensive building products and energy fuels. Here we determined displacement factors for wood substitution in the built environment and bioenergy at the national level in Canada. For solid wood products, we compiled a basket of end-use products and determined the reduction in emissions for two functionally equivalent products: a more wood-intensive product vs. a less wood-intensive one. Avoided emissions for end-use products basket were weighted by Canadian consumption statistics to reflect national wood uses, and avoided emissions were further partitioned into displacement factors for sawnwood and panels. We also examined two bioenergy feedstock scenarios (constant supply and constrained supply) to estimate displacement factors for bioenergy using an optimized selection of bioenergy facilities which maximized avoided emissions from fossil fuels. Results demonstrated that the average displacement factors were found to be similar: product displacement factors were 0.54 tC displaced per tC of used for sawnwood and 0.45 tC tC(-1) for panels; energy displacement factors for the two feedstock scenarios were 0.47 tC tC(-1) for the constant supply and 0.89 tC tC(-1) for the constrained supply. However, there was a wide range of substitution impacts. The greatest avoided emissions occurred when wood was substituted for steel and concrete in buildings, and when bioenergy from heat facilities and/or combined heat and power facilities was substituted for energy from high-emissions fossil fuels. We conclude that (1) national-level substitution benefits need to be considered within a systems perspective on climate change mitigation to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (2) the use of long-lived wood products in buildings to displace steel and concrete reduces GHG emissions, (3) the greatest bioenergy substitution benefits are achieved using a mix of facility types and capacities to displace emissions-intensive fossil fuels.									22	2	0	9	0	24	2	16	1757-1693	1757-1707		WOS:000402743500006		J	Hossain, Md.

Therefore, a green science application is proposed in this article to meet the total energy, water, and gas demands for a building, which can be produced by the building itself without any outside connections and is also 100% clean. To meet 100% of the energy demands of a building, a design theory is implemented wherein at least 25% of the exterior curtain wall skin and roof is used as a blackbody assisted photovoltaic (PV) panel to capture solar energy and convert it to electricity. The domestic water supply is provided by in-house treatment processes (filtration, chlorination, UV treatment and purification) from in-situ groundwater extraction by PV-panel-assisted pumping. Subsequently, the domestic waste undergoes a transformation process wherein sludge, consisting mainly of human feces, is collected in a closed anaerobic detention tank in a cellar and introduced into a bioreactor, enabling the production of biogas by methanogenesis; this biogas is then stored and used for cooking and HVAC equipment. Finally, the separated wastewater is treated in the cellar by applying primary, secondary, and tertiary processes and is then used for gardening, irrigation, and landscaping. The combination of these technologies, wherein a building can produce electricity, water, and gas without outside connections, is a major scientific innovation expected to dramatically mitigate the global energy, environmental, and climate change crises.									6	0	0	0	0	6	2	60	1364-0321			WOS:000401204700053		J	Kumar, Pradeep; Ghose, M.

Assessment of carbon in forests using remote sensing and GIS tools is one of the most important aspects of rapid and verifiable methodologies. A number of studies have shown the utility of spectral (vegetation) indices like NDVI in the assessment of forest carbon. However, there are limitations to this approach. The mountainous topography and high biodiversity affect the spectral values in pixels in multiple ways. The present article aims to test the validity of use of vegetation indices in high-biodiversity forests in mountains by modelling the ground based forest carbon measurement with vegetation indices of NDVI, EVI, SAVI and MSAVI in a multi-sensor, multi-season data environment with multiple regression methods like linear, power, logarithmic, polynomial and exponential. It is found that all the regressions have a poor coefficient of determination not even exceeding 0.2. It is concluded that the remote sensing-based spectral vegetation indices alone cannot be a proxy for forest carbon calculators in high biodiversity mountain forests.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	23	0011-3891			WOS:000401737600024		J	Teh, Soo Huey; Wiedmann, Thomas; Castel, Arnaud; de Burgh, James				Wiedmann, Thomas/C-9158-2011	Wiedmann, Thomas/0000-0002-6395-8887			Hybrid life cycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from cement, concrete and geopolymer concrete in Australia								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				152				312	320		10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.122				MAY 20 2017	2017	Concrete is the second most used material after water and the production of cement is responsible for 5-8% of global carbon dioxide emissions. The development of low-carbon concretes is pursued worldwide to help the construction industry make its contribution to decarbonising the built environment and achieving carbon reduction targets agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement. However, there is uncertainty around the actual amount of greenhouse gas emissions that can be avoided by employing alternative types of concrete. This study quantifies the carbon footprint intensities of Australian cement and concrete production, including ordinary Portland cement, standard ordinary Portland cement concrete, blended cement-based concrete and geopolymer concrete production. For the first time, an input-output based hybrid life-cycle assessment method is used for these products. The main goal of this paper is therefore to make a methodological comparison between process-based and hybrid life cycle assessment using the Australian cement and concrete production as a case study. A comparison with published results from process-based life-cycle inventories as well as a decomposition of results into product categories is provided. The hybrid life cycle assessment resulted in higher greenhouse gas emissions for ordinary Portland cement and all types of concrete due to the methodology incorporating an economy-wide system boundary, which includes the emissions from upstream processes. For geopolymer concrete in particular, the results were also dependent on the method applied for allocating greenhouse gas emissions from fly ash and slag. The findings from this study are likely to inform the development of strategies and policies aimed at greenhouse gas reduction in the cement and concrete industries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although displacement of coal with SNG benefits air quality, it increases CO2 emissions. Due to variations in air pollutant and CO2 emission factors and energy efficiencies across sectors, coal replacementwith SNG results in varying degrees of air quality benefits and climate penalties. We estimate air quality, human health, and climate impacts of SNG substitution strategies in 2020. Using all production of SNG in the residential sector results in an annual decrease of similar to 32,000 (20,000 to 41,000) outdoor-air-pollutionassociated premature deaths, with ranges determined by the low and high estimates of the health risks. If changes in indoor/ household air pollution were also included, the decrease would be far larger. SNG deployment in the residential sector results in nearly 10 and 60 times greater reduction in premature mortality than if it is deployed in the industrial or power sectors, respectively. Due to inefficiencies in current household coal use, utilization of SNG in the residential sector results in only 20 to 30% of the carbon penalty compared with using it in the industrial or power sectors. Even if carbon capture and storage is used in SNG production with today's technology, SNG emits 22 to 40% more CO2 than the same amount of conventional gas. Among the SNG deployment strategies we evaluate, allocating currently planned SNG to households provides the largest air quality and health benefits with the smallest carbon penalties.									35	0	0	15	0	35	3	70	0027-8424			WOS:000400818400031	28438993	J	Ahmed, Nesar; Bunting, Stuart W.; Glaser, Marion; Flaherty, Mark S.; Diana, James S.

AMBIO				46	4			468	477		10.1007/s13280-016-0849-7				MAY 2017	2017	Globally, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions have been seriously augmented due to the devastating effects of anthropogenic pressures on coastal ecosystems including mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. The greening of aquaculture, however, including an ecosystem approach to Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture (IAA) and Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) could play a significant role in reversing this trend, enhancing coastal ecosystems, and sequestering blue carbon. Ponds within IAA farming systems sequester more carbon per unit area than conventional fish ponds, natural lakes, and inland seas. The translocation of shrimp culture from mangrove swamps to offshore IMTA could reduce mangrove loss, reverse blue carbon emissions, and in turn increase storage of blue carbon through restoration of mangroves. Moreover, offshore IMTA may create a barrier to trawl fishing which in turn could help restore seagrasses and further enhance blue carbon sequestration. Seaweed and shellfish culture within IMTA could also help to sequester more blue carbon. The greening of aquaculture could face several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize substantial benefits from enhanced blue carbon sequestration and eventually contribute to global climate change mitigation.									7	2	0	4	0	8	8	107	0044-7447	1654-7209		WOS:000399228700007	27848102	J	Kester, Johannes; Sovacool, Benjamin K.

The argument being that we need a similar rapid and total shift in our industrial social and economic environment to prevent or at least address the pending impacts of climate change. This argument and these studies have inspired us to think with them on what it means to use the WWII war analogy as a security claim in energy and climate change debates. Here, we would like to use this opportunity to draw attention to some of the implicit dangers of a call to war in such discussions. Among others we observe, first, the absence of any attention to the actual mobilization policies, in terms of garnishing public support. Second, based on the insights from Critical Security Studies, we question the historical incongruence of the case study especially by comparing the perceived enemy in both cases. Lastly, building on that same security literature, we point to some undesirable and perhaps unintended consequences of the use of war analogies in climate change debates.									2	0	0	0	0	2	2	16	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000397549500006		J	Hagemann, Nikolas; Harter, Johannes; Kaldamukova, Radina; Guzman-Bustamante, Ivan; Ruser, Reiner; Graeff, Simone; Kappler, Andreas; Behrens, Sebastian					Guzman-Bustamante, Ivan/0000-0001-6891-0041; Kappler, Andreas/0000-0002-3558-9500			Does soil aging affect the N2O mitigation potential of biochar? A combined microcosm and field study								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY				9	5			953	964		10.1111/gcbb.12390				MAY 2017	2017	The application of biochar as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility has been suggested as a tool to reduce soil-borne CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, especially nitrous oxide (N2O). Both laboratory and field trials have demonstrated N2O emission reduction by biochar amendment, but the long-term effect (> 1 year) has been questioned. Here, we present results of a combined microcosm and field study using a powdered beech wood biochar from slow pyrolysis. The field experiment showed that both CO2 and N2O emissions were still effectively reduced by biochar in the third year after application. However, biochar did not influence the biomass yield of sunflower for biogas production (Helianthus annuus L.). Biochar reduced bulk density and increased soil aeration and thus reduced the water-filled pore space (WFPS) in the field, but was also able to suppress N2O emission in the microcosms experiment conducted at constant WFPS. For both experiments, biochar had limited impact on soil mineral nitrogen speciation, but it reduced the accumulation of nitrite in the microcosms. Extraction of soil DNA and quantification of functional marker genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that biochar did not alter the abundance of nitrogen- transforming bacteria and archaea in both field and microcosm experiments. In contradiction to previous experiments, this study demonstrates the long-term N2O emission suppression potential of a wood biochar and thus highlights its overall climate change mitigation potential. While a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms requires further research, we provide evidence for a range of biochar-induced changes to the soil environment and their change with time that might explain the often observed N2O emission suppression.									16	3	0	15	0	19	2	82	1757-1693	1757-1707		WOS:000402742500009		J	Quam, Vivian G.

Two literature searches were conducted on: (1) active transport health co-benefits, and (2) dietary health co-benefits. Articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes. A data extraction tool (PRISMA) was created for article selection and evaluation. A rubric was devised to assess the biases, limitations and uncertainties of included articles. For active transport 790 articles were retrieved, nine meeting the inclusion criteria. For diet 2524 articles were retrieved, 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric, as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co-benefits. Methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta-analysis. The scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Effective mitigation policies, infrastructure that supports active transport and low GHGE food delivery, plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and GHGE outcomes. Variation in culture, nutritional and health status, plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario(s) best suit individual communities.									11	0	0	2	0	11	1	19	1660-4601			WOS:000404106400016	28448460	J	Seghetta, Michele; Romeo, Daina; D'Este, Martina; Alvarado-Morales, Merlin; Angelidaki, Irini; Bastianoni, Simone; Thomsen, Marianne				; Alvarado-Morales, Merlin/I-3829-2016	Angelidaki, Irini/0000-0002-6357-578X; Romeo, Daina/0000-0003-0233-1308; Thomsen, Marianne/0000-0003-2453-5141; Alvarado-Morales, Merlin/0000-0003-3689-4563; Seghetta, Michele/0000-0003-3316-790X			Seaweed as innovative feedstock for energy and feed - Evaluating the impacts through a Life Cycle Assessment								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				150				1	15		10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.022				MAY 1 2017	2017	Offshore cultivation of seaweed provides an innovative feedstock for biobased products supporting blue growth in northern Europe. This paper analyzes two alternative exploitation pathways: energy and protein production. The first pathway is based on anaerobic digestion of seaweed which is converted into biogas, for production of electricity and heat, and digestate, used as fertilizer; the second pathway uses seaweed hydrolysate as a substrate for cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae. As a result the seaweed sugars are consumed while new proteins are produced enhancing the total output. We performed a comparative Life Cycle Assessment of five scenarios identifying the critical features affecting resource efficiency and environmental performance of the systems with the aim of providing decision support for the design of future industrial scale production processes. The results show that all scenarios provide environmental benefits in terms of mitigation of climate change, with biogas production from dried Laminaria digitata being the most favorable scenario, quantified as -18.7*10(2) kg CO2 eq./ha. This scenario presents also the lowest consumption of total cumulative energy demand, 1.7*10(4) MJ/ha, and even resulting in a net reduction of the fossil energy fraction, -1.9*10(4) MJ/ha compared to a situation without seaweed cultivation. All scenarios provide mitigation of marine eutrophication thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen and phosphorus during seaweed growth. The material consumption for seeded lines has 2-20 times higher impact on human toxicity (cancer) than the reduction achieved by energy and protein substitution. However, minor changes in cultivation design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer). Externalities from the use of digestate as fertilizer affect human toxicity (non-cancer) due to transfer of arsenic from aquatic environment to agricultural soil. However concentration of heavy metals in digestate does not exceed the limit established by Danish regulation. The assessment identifies seaweed productivity as the key parameter to further improve the performance of the production systems which are a promising service provider of environmental restoration and climate change mitigation.

To meet climate change mitigation targets, environmental policy instruments have been designed to transform the way goods and services are produced as well as alter consumption patterns. The government of Malaysia is strongly committed to reducing CO2 gas emissions as a proportion of GDP by 40% from 2005 levels by the year 2020. This study evaluates the economy-wide impacts of implementing two different types of CO2 emission abatement policies in Malaysia using market-based (imposing a carbon tax) and command-and-control mechanism (sectoral emission standards). The policy simulations conducted involve the removal of the subsidy on petroleum products by the government. A carbon emission tax in conjunction with the revenue neutrality assumption is seen to be more effective than a command-and-control policy as it provides a double dividend. This is apparent as changes in consumption patterns lead to welfare enhancements while contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions. The simulation results show that the production of renewable energies is stepped up when the imposition of carbon tax and removal of the subsidy is augmented by revenue recycling. This study provides an economy-wide assessment that compares two important tools for assisting environment policy makers evaluate carbon emission abatement initiatives in Malaysia.

Enhanced carbon storage through management for old-growth characteristics in northern hardwood-conifer forests								ECOSPHERE				8	4					e01721	10.1002/ecs2.1721				APR 2017	2017	Forest management practices emphasizing stand structural complexity are of interest across the northern forest region of the United States because of their potential to enhance carbon storage. Our research is part of a long-term study evaluating silvicultural treatments that promote late-successional forest characteristics in northern hardwood-conifer forests. We are testing the hypothesis that aboveground biomass development (carbon storage) is greater in structural complexity enhancement (SCE) treatments when compared to conventional uneven-aged treatments. Structural complexity enhancement treatments were compared against selection systems (single-tree and group) modified to retain elevated structure. Manipulations and controls were replicated across 2-ha treatment units at two study areas in Vermont, United States. Data on aboveground biomass pools (live trees, standing dead, and downed wood) were collected pre- and post-treatment, then again a decade later. Species group-specific allometric equations were used to estimate live and standing dead biomass, and downed log biomass was estimated volumetrically. We used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to project no-treatment baselines specific to treatment units, allowing measured carbon responses to be normalized against differences in site characteristics affecting tree growth and pre-treatment stand structure. Results indicate that biomass development and carbon storage 10yr post-treatment were greatest in SCE treatments compared to conventional treatments, with the greatest increases in coarse woody material (CWM) pools. Structural complexity enhancement treatments contained 12.67Mg/ha carbon in CWM compared to 6.62Mg/ha in conventional treatments and 8.84Mg/ha in areas with no treatment. Percentage differences between post-treatment carbon and simulated/projected baseline values indicate that carbon pool values in SCE treatments returned closest to pre-harvest or untreated levels over conventional treatments. Total carbon storage in SCE aboveground pools was 15.90% less than that projected for no-treatment compared to 44.94% less in conventionally treated areas. Results from classification and regression tree models indicated treatment as the strongest predictor of aboveground C storage followed by site-specific variables, suggesting a strong influence of both on carbon pools. Structural enhancement treatments have the potential to increase carbon storage in managed northern hardwoods. They offer an alternative for sustainable management integrating carbon, associated climate change mitigation benefits, and late-successional forest structure and habitat.									13	1	0	10	0	14	1	31	2150-8925			WOS:000400985300005		J	Kohler, Florent; Brondizio, Eduardo S.

Empowering local communities as central partners in conservation and climate-change mitigation has allowed many people to gain access to land and citizenship rights but has provided limited improvements in access to social services and economic opportunities even as expectation about their role as environmental stewards grows. These expectations, however, are inconsistent with reality. We conducted multiple field studies in Brazil since the mid-1980s to illustrate the discrepancies between conservation programs and local conditions and expectations. We suggest that public policies and conservation programs should not delegate responsibility for managing protected areas to local and indigenous communities without considering local needs and expectations and locals' attitudes toward conservation. In other words, behavior that maintains or improves the environment should not be treated as traditional based on the expectations of outsiders. Framing local populations as traditional environmentalists creates contradictions and frustrations for local populations and for conservation professionals and policy makers.									11	0	0	5	1	12	3	66	0888-8892	1523-1739		WOS:000395713800001	27717009	J	Riti, Joshua Sunday; Shu, Yang; Song, Deyong; Kamah, Miriam				Riti, Joshua S./Q-7631-2019				The contribution of energy use and financial development by source in climate change mitigation process: A global empirical perspective								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				148				882	894		10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.037				APR 1 2017	2017	The danger of climate change has over the years become a reality in the public domain. While efforts to mitigate climate change involve energy mix, energy efficiency and cleaner technology, financial development has also been considered as an important factor. Indicator of financial development may draw FDI and advanced degree of research and development which can accelerate economic growth and hence affect dynamism of environmental performance. This study examines the impacts of energy use and financial development indicators by source in the environment-growth-energy model for 90 countries categorized on the basis of income possession over the period 1980-2014. The study applies the panel analysis that accounts for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity of series used in the estimation. Results from panel Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) show that in all the categories of countries, fossil fuel energy use and GDP per capita are found to be the major drivers of CO2 emissions though fossil fuel energy use possesses the bigger elasticities. Population however, displays a sign contrary to expectation regarding economic theory in high income countries. Renewable energy and financial development on the other hand are capable of reducing CO2 emissions. However, the magnitude of the long-run elasticity of CO2 emissions with respect to renewable energy use and financial development are much greater in the models with M-2/GDP than the model with M-2/Reserve especially in the high income countries. Policies should be geared towards stimulating investments in renewable energy technology. There is need to develop robust financial systems to lend financial credence to research institutes to work towards producing energy that have less carbon or are carbon-free. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This has been an expectation and a hotly contested issue in REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) since its inception. While the core purpose of REDD+ is to reduce carbon emissions, its legitimacy and success also depend on its impacts on local well-being. To effectively safeguard against negative impacts, we need to know whether and which well-being outcomes can be attributed to REDD+. Yet, distinguishing the effects of choosing particular locations for REDD+ from the effects of the interventions themselves remains a challenge. The Global Comparative Study (GCS) on REDD+ employed a quasi-experimental before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study design to address this challenge and evaluate the impacts of 16 REDD+ pilots across the tropics. We find that the GCS approach allows identification of control groups that represent the counterfactual, thereby permitting attribution of outcomes to REDD+. The GCS experience belies many of the common critiques of the BACI design, especially concerns about collecting baseline data on control groups. Our findings encourage and validate the early planning and up-front investments required to evaluate the local impacts of global climate change mitigation efforts with confidence. The stakes are high, both for the global environment and for local populations directly affected by those efforts. The standards for evidence should be concomitantly high. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This article presents new findings on climate change risks of healthcare waste disposal during and after the 2010 earthquake and cholera disasters in Haiti. The researchers analysed quantities of healthcare waste incinerated by the United Nations Mission in Haiti for 60 months (2009 to 2013). The aim was to determine the relationship between healthcare waste incinerated weights and the time of occurrence of the two disasters, and associated climate change effects, if any. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient indicated a weak correlation between the quantities of healthcare waste disposed of and the time of occurrence of the actual emergencies (r (58) = 0.406, p = 0.001). Correspondingly, linear regression analysis indicated a relatively linear data trend (R-2 = 0.16, F (1, 58) = 11.42, P = 0.001) with fluctuating scenarios that depicted a sharp rise in 2012, and time series model showed monthly and yearly variations within 60 months. Given that the peak healthcare waste incineration occurred 2 years after the 2010 disasters, points at the need to minimise wastage on pharmaceuticals by improving logistics management. The Government of Haiti had no data on healthcare waste disposal and practised smoky open burning, thus a need for capacity building on green healthcare waste management technologies for effective climate change mitigation.									2	0	0	1	0	2	1	17	0734-242X	1096-3669		WOS:000398120700004	28110630	J	Javed, Humayun; Mukhtar, Tariq; Javed, Khadija; ul Mohsin, Ata				Mukhtar, Tariq/D-3201-2011	Mukhtar, Tariq/0000-0002-0379-3320			MANAGEMENT OF EGGPLANT SHOOT AND FRUIT BORER (Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee) BY INTEGRATING DIFFERENT NON-CHEMICAL APPROACHES								PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES				54	1			65	70		10.21162/PAKJAS/17.5282				MAR 2017	2017	Eggplant shoot and fruit borer (ESFB), Leucinodes orbonalis Guenee, a destructive pest of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), adversely affects quality and yield of eggplant fruit throughout the world. Currently, its management is mainly relied on insecticides which are inimical to humans, livestock and environment. To get rid of the pernicious consequences of chemicals, use of alternative non-chemical approaches has been emphasized. Ergo, in the present study non-chemical methods viz. hoeing, clipping of damaged fruits and shoots and weeding at weekly intervals and a biocontrol agent Trichogramma chilonis individually and in combination were assessed for the management of ESFB. All the treatments though varied in their efficacies, caused significant reductions in infestation of ESFB and increased yield as compared to control. Combination of practices gave better results as compared to individual treatments with few exceptions. In general, the combined treatment (T. chilonis + hoeing + clipping) was found to be the most effective in reducing pest infestations and increasing yield followed by another combined treatment where hoeing, clipping and weeding were applied conjointly. Application of T. chilonis singly was the least effective treatment; however, incorporation of T. chilonis with other practices gave good results. Similarly, integration of hoeing with clipping of infested shoots and fruits at weekly intervals also proved satisfactory in reducing pest infestation and enhancing yield. It is concluded that integration of non-chemical approaches will help reduce infestation of ESFB significantly and will make a major contribution to both climate-change mitigation and sustainable crop production systems.									19	0	0	11	0	19	0	2	0552-9034	2076-0906		WOS:000395424800010		J	Espinoza Perez, Andrea Teresa; Camargo, Mauricio; Narvaez Rincon, Paulo Cesar; Alfaro Marchant, Miguel				Narvaez, Paulo/I-4635-2019; Espinoza Perez, Andrea Teresa/M-4426-2014	Espinoza Perez, Andrea Teresa/0000-0002-6362-9100; Narvaez Rincon, Paulo Cesar/0000-0003-4865-4540; Camargo, Mauricio/0000-0003-3867-2438			Key challenges and requirements for sustainable and industrialized biorefinery supply chain design and management: A bibliographic analysis								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				69				350	359		10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.084				MAR 2017	2017	The growing global population and its effects on world food security, as well as the urgency for climate change mitigation, are issues that foster technological, social, and political innovations to increase the efficiency of use of natural resources, such as biomass among others. While significant research efforts have been devoted to biomass conversion processes, their associated supply chains and their implication for complete process efficiency have only been studied more recently. However, most of the recent investigations into the design and optimization of biomass supply chains have focused on an economic point of view, sidelining other dimensions of sustainability, which represents a serious drawback for this kind of work. This article surveys the recent research on design and management optimization of biorefinery supply chains from a sustainability perspective. 72 published research articles from 2006 to 2015 have been analyzed to highlight the sustainability dimensions considered, as well as the inclusion of uncertainties. A typology of decision-making at three levels of analysis (strategic, tactical and operational), and the specific set of tools used to model and optimize the biorefinery supply chain have also been studied. The conclusion underlines the contributions and shortcomings of current research and suggests possible future directions.									29	0	0	4	0	29	4	96	1364-0321			WOS:000393016000030		J	Oree, Vishwamitra; Hassen, Sayed Z.

It usually involves solving a large-scale, non-linear discrete and dynamic optimisation problem in a highly constrained and uncertain environment. Traditional approaches to capacity planning have focused on achieving a least-cost plan. During the last two decades however, new paradigms for expansion planning have emerged that are driven by environmental and political factors. This has resulted in the formulation of multi-criteria approaches that enable power system planners to simultaneously consider multiple and conflicting objectives in the decision-making process. More recently, the increasing integration of intermittent renewable energy sources in the grid to sustain power system decarbonisation and energy security has introduced new challenges. Such a transition spawns new dynamics pertaining to the variability and uncertainty of these generation resources in determining the best mix. In addition to ensuring adequacy of generation capacity, it is essential to consider the operational characteristics of the generation sources in the planning process. In this paper, we first review the evolution of generation expansion planning techniques in the face of more stringent environmental policies and growing uncertainty. More importantly, we highlight the emerging challenges presented by the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources. In particular, we discuss the power supply adequacy and operational flexibility issues introduced by variable renewable sources as well as the attempts made to address them. Finally, we identify important future research directions.									42	1	0	0	0	43	3	53	1364-0321			WOS:000393016000065		J	Nolte, Christoph; de Waroux, Yann le Polain; Munger, Jacob; Reis, Tiago N.

Public and private anti-deforestation policies have been shown to effectively reduce forest loss, but the conditions under which such policies get adopted are rarely examined. Here we propose a set of conditions that we expect to be associated with the adoption of effective anti-deforestation policies in commodity frontiers. We then examine whether these conditions have influenced policy adoption in South America's major soy-and-cattle frontiers: the Brazilian Amazon, the Cerrado, the Chaco, the Chiquitano, and Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. By collating empirical data from diverse sources, including literature review, extensive expert interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary data, we show that the Cerrado, the Chaco, and the Chiquitano differ from the Brazilian Amazon in multiple ways that might have inhibited adoptions of effective anti-deforestation instruments. These conditions include: a higher importance of the agricultural sector within the respective countries, lower carbon stocks and species richness, higher prevalence of private land tenure, and higher baseline compliance with forest reserve regulations on private lands. We also observe that the adoption of the most effective private anti-deforestation instrument, commodity moratoria, may respond to similar conditions as those influencing the adoption of public instruments. Incentivizing public and private actors to adopt effective anti-deforestation policies in the Cerrado, Chaco, and the Chiquitano will likely be more challenging than it has been in the Brazilian Amazon.

This constrains humanity's ability to protect our planet's climate and life-sustaining functions. The substantial body of research we review reveals that forest, water and energy interactions provide the foundations for carbon storage, for cooling terrestrial surfaces and for distributing water resources. Forests and trees must be recognized as prime regulators within the water, energy and carbon cycles. If these functions are ignored, planners will be unable to assess, adapt to or mitigate the impacts of changing land cover and climate. Our call to action targets a reversal of paradigms, from a carbon-centric model to one that treats the hydrologic and climate-cooling effects of trees and forests as the first order of priority. For reasons of sustainability, carbon storage must remain a secondary, though valuable, by-product. The effects of tree cover on climate at local, regional and continental scales offer benefits that demand wider recognition. The forest- and tree-centered research insights we review and analyze provide a knowledge-base for improving plans, policies and actions. Our understanding of how trees and forests influence water, energy and carbon cycles has important implications, both for the structure of planning, management and governance institutions, as well as for how trees and forests might be used to improve sustainability, adaptation and mitigation efforts.

Electrification, via mass market adoption of plug-in vehicles (i.e. battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), has emerged as a front runner for road transport across the globe, but there are concerns that the pace and extent implied by many modeling studies is problematic and that assessment of (a) the heterogeneity in the market, (b) other low carbon vectors (e.g. conventional hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell) and (c) life cycle energy and environmental impacts have been relatively neglected. This paper aims to fill these gaps by examining the timing, scale and impacts of the uptake of plug-in vehicles in the heterogeneous UK car market from a consumer perspective. To achieve this aim it (a) brings together a bespoke disaggregated model of the transport-energy environment system (the UK Transport Carbon Model) with previous work by the authors on heterogeneity in the demand for and supply of plug-in vehicles and (b) applies the improved model to develop future low carbon scenarios that assess the potential impact of different investment pathways and policy approaches to the electrification of cars with the view to meeting the UK's legally binding carbon budgets to 2050. The results show the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity in and dynamic nature of the car market in terms of new technology adoption by private consumers, so called 'user choosers' and fleet managers, as well as accounting for potential effects on wider life cycle emissions resulting from different uptake pathways. It allows an assessment of the effectiveness of different policy instruments, market conditions (vehicle supply, private vs fleet market, vehicle segments) and social factors (consumer awareness, range "anxiety", perceived charging requirements) on different consumer segments, thus providing more policy-focused conclusions on the likely pathways to high penetration of plug-in vehicles that may be required to meet future carbon and air quality targets.

Emissions factors are calculated from baseline estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) stored in different vegetation types. Ground-based methods for estimating AGB, such as forest inventories, despite being relatively accurate and necessary for calibrating remotely sensed data such as satellite or airborne Light Detection and Ranging, tend to be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, calls have been made to improve the cost-efficiency of these methods within the context of REDD+. Also as part of REDD+, there have been calls for the legitimate inclusion of indigenous peoples and rural communities in various aspects of the mechanism. To address both of these issues, we devised a participatory, rapid, forest inventorying method and tested it across the heterogeneous forest landscape of Darien, Panama. This effort took place within a project that was administratively and logistically managed entirely by an indigenous organization working in collaboration with indigenous authorities in Darien, with funding from the World Bank. A group of 24 indigenous technicians were trained on forest inventorying methods. They established and measured thirty 1-ha plots under our direct supervision. We tested for various sources of error in tree diameter and height measurements. We also tested the scalability of our tree-level biomass estimates to the plot level by comparing our results with simulations conducted on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha permanent plot data. Results indicate that our rapid, participatory, forest inventorying method effectively captures plot-level AGB, while guaranteeing the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples. The benefits of our method in terms of cost-efficiency and access to remote forest areas are discussed, as well as those accrued by indigenous peoples.									5	0	0	3	0	5	2	16	2150-8925			WOS:000397091300024		J	Elum, Z.

However, its production and utilization leads to undesirable carbon emissions that aggravate global warming which results in climate change. The agriculture sector is a significant user of energy. However, it has the potential to be a major contributor to Nigeria's energy supply mix in meeting its energy deficit. More so, in the light of current and impending adverse effects of climate change, there is a need to contain GHG's emissions. This paper focuses on bioenergy utilization as a climate change mitigation strategy and one that can, through effective waste management, enhance sustainable economic development in Nigeria. The paper employed a critical discourse analysis to examine the potential of the agricultural sector to provide biofuels from energy crops and other biomass sources. We conclude that Nigeria can reduce its GHG emissions and greatly contribute to global climate change mitigation while also alleviating its energy supply deficit if the agricultural and municipal wastes readily available in its towns and cities are converted to bioenergy. Such engagements will not only promote a clean and healthy environment but also create jobs for economic empowerment and a better standard of living for the people.									3	0	0	1	0	3	0	25	0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000397004600006	27933500	J	Work, Courtney					Work, Courtney/0000-0003-4454-0247			Forest Islands and Castaway Communities: REDD plus and Forest Restoration in Prey Lang Forest								FORESTS				8	2					47	10.3390/f8020047				FEB 2017	2017	Climate Change policies are playing an ever-increasing role in global development strategies and their implementation gives rise to often-unforeseen social conflicts and environmental degradations. A landscape approach to analyzing forest-based Climate Change Mitigation policies (CCM) and land grabs in the Prey Lang Forest landscape, Cambodia revealed two Korea-Cambodia partnership projects designed to increase forest cover that are juxtaposed in this paper. Case study data revealed a REDD+ project with little negative impact or social conflict in the project area and an Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) project that created both social and ecological conflicts. The study concludes that forest-based CCM policies can reduce conflict through efforts at minimal transformation of local livelihoods, maximal attention to the tenure rights, responsibilities, and authority of citizens, and by improving, not degrading, the project landscapes. The paper presents the circumstances under which these guidelines are sidestepped by the A/R project, and importantly reveals that dramatic forest and livelihood transformation had already affected the community and environment in the REDD+ project site. There are deep contradictions at the heart of climate change policies toward which attention must be given, lest we leave our future generations with nothing but forest islands and castaway communities.									8	0	0	1	0	8	0	9	1999-4907			WOS:000395659200018		J	Sarigiannis, D.

Cities have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions as most of the traffic, industry, commerce and more than 50% of world population is situated in urban areas. Southern Europe is a region that faces financial turmoil, enhanced migratory fluxes and climate change pressure. The case study of Thessaloniki is presented, one of the only two cities in Greece with established climate change action plans. The effects of feasible traffic policies in year 2020 are assessed and their potential health impact is compared to a business as usual scenario. Two types of measures are investigated: operation of underground rail in the city centre and changes in fleet composition. Potential co-benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions on public health by the year 2020 are computed utilizing state-of-the-art concentration response functions for PMx, NO2 and C6H6. Results show significant environmental health and monetary co-benefits when the city metro is coupled with appropriate changes in the traffic composition. Monetary savings due to avoided mortality or leukaemia incidence corresponding to the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure will be 56.6, 45, 37.7 and 1.0 million Euros respectively. Promotion of 'green' transportation in the city (i.e. the wide use of electric vehicles), will provide monetary savings from the reduction in PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and C6H6 exposure up to 60.4, 49.1, 41.2 and 1.08 million Euros. Overall, it was shown that the respective GHG emission reduction policies resulted in clear co-benefits in terms of air quality improvement, public health protection and monetary loss mitigation.

This study investigated the representation of biofuels in political cartoons on the Internet. Political cartoons have relied on informative, persuasive, and performative attributes to engender critical reflection and mobilize action. We analyzed a corpus of 130 relevant cartoons obtained through Google Images which were then thematically categorized. The problems highlighted in these cartoons focused on the social injustices arising from the diversion of food sources to fuel, the environmental destruction arising from deforestation, the unfulfilled expectations for climate change mitigation, and the policy contradictions that emerged. We suggest that political cartoons' discursive dimensions allow us to make immediate connections between the image and our cultural stores of meaning, while at the same time further elucidate the dilemmas and contradictions embedded in the public's interface with biofuels as an environmental issue.									2	0	0	1	0	2	0	12	1752-4032	1752-4040		WOS:000392489800003		J	Bryngelsson, David; Hedenus, Fredrik; Johansson, Daniel J.

ENERGIES				10	2					182	10.3390/en10020182				FEB 2017	2017	We investigate how different global dietary scenarios affect the constraints on, and costs of, transforming the energy system to reach a global temperature stabilization limit of 2 degrees C above the pre-industrial level. A global food and agriculture model, World Food Supply Model (WOFSUM), is used to create three dietary scenarios and to calculate the CH4 and N2O emissions resulting from their respective food-supply chains. The diets are: (i) a reference diet based on current trends; (ii) a diet with high (reference-level) meat consumption, but without ruminant products (i.e., no beef, lamb, or dairy, only pork and poultry); and (iii) a vegan diet. The estimated CH4 and N2O emissions from food production are fed into a coupled energy and climate-system optimization model to quantify the energy system implications of the different dietary scenarios, given a 2 degrees C target. The results indicate that a phase-out of ruminant products substantially increases the emission space for CO2 by about 250 GtC which reduces the necessary pace of the energy system transition and cuts the net present value energy-system mitigation costs by 25%, for staying below 2 degrees C. Importantly, the additional cost savings with a vegan diet--beyond those achieved with a phase-out of ruminant products--are marginal (only one additional percentage point). This means that a general reduction of meat consumption is a far less effective strategy for meeting the 2 degrees C target than a reduction of beef and dairy consumption.									4	0	0	2	0	4	0	79		1996-1073		WOS:000395469200036		J	Lott, Melissa C.; Pye, Steve; Dodds, Paul E.

Policy targets to achieve decarbonisation goals for national energy systems will therefore impact levels of air pollution. Advantages can be gained from considering these co-impacts when analysing technology transition scenarios in order to avoid tension between climate change and air quality policies. We incorporated non-GHG air pollution into a bottom-up, technoeconomic energy systems model that is at the core of UK decarbonisation policy development. We then used this model to assess the co-impacts of decarbonisation on other types of air pollution and evaluated the extent to which transition pathways would be altered if these other pollutants were considered. In a scenario where the UK meets its existing decarbonisation targets to 2050, including the costs of non-GHG air pollution led to a 40% and 45% decrease in PM10 and PM2.5 pollution (respectively) between 2010 and 2050 due to changes in technology choice in residential heating. Conversely, limited change in the pollution profile for transportation were observed, suggesting that other policy strategies will be necessary to reduce pollution from transport.									18	0	0	4	0	18	1	24	0301-4215	1873-6777		WOS:000392768800005		J	Tegegne, Yitagesu T.; Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta; Fobissie, Kalame; Visseren-Hamakers, Ingrid J.; Lindner, Marcus; Kanninen, Markku				Kanninen, Markku/S-7684-2016	Kanninen, Markku/0000-0002-5708-9443; Lindner, Marcus/0000-0002-0770-003X			Synergies among social safeguards in FLEGT and REDD plus in Cameroon								FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS				75				1	11		10.1016/j.forpol.2016.11.005				FEB 2017	2017	Two key international policy processes have been developed to combat illegal logging and promote the contribution of forests to climate change mitigation in developing countries: the European Union's Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) and its Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs), and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change policy on Reduding Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +). The implementation of these policies raises concerns about unintended adverse effects on the environment and local peoples' livelihoods. To prevent such effects, both processes involve developing country-level safeguards, so that they 'do no harm'. This paper presents (i) a comparison of the social safeguards of the FLEGT-VPA and REDD+ processes and an explanation of their commonalities and differences, and (ii) an exploration of the potential synergies and the challenges to realiling them. The three Main research methods used in the study were semi-structured interviews, content analysis of policy documents, and focus group discussions with local communities and indigenous peoples in south and east Cameroon. Our analysis shows that whereas FLEGT-VPA includes legality-based safeguards with legally binding monitoring and reporting obligations, REDD + adopts a right-based approach to safeguards. Potential synergies between the two approaches were identified. The synergies lie in the participatory nature of the process of designing benefit sharing mechanisms, strengthening forest and land tenure, and defining the criteria and indicators in FLEGT-VPA and REDD + safeguards. However, realizing the synergies is challenging, given the existing political economy of Cameroon. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The management strategies should be context-specific, and will require consideration of different stakeholders' interests, and of the local soil and climatic conditions. We developed a framework to analyse nitrogen (N) management options with the objective of increasing crop production while reducing CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil, and applied this framework to Australian rainfed wheat systems using a systems modelling approach. The results indicated that modified N management strategies in Australian rainfed wheat systems could increase average grain yield by up to 76% (from 1.7 to 3.0 Mg ha(-1)) while substantially reducing net soil and N2O emissions (expressed in CO2 equivalents, CO2-eq), compared with current farming practice. Meta-modelling of the simulation results from 613 sites across the Australian wheat growing regions indicated that site-specific best N management aimed at increasing yield and reducing net soil CO2-eq emissions significantly correlated with water availability, temperature, and antecedent soil carbon content. The results emphasise the opportunity for well-managed intensification to simultaneously increase yield and reduce soil CO2 and N2O emissions in Australian rainfed cropping regions. The 'win-win' N management recommendations should, and can be specified according to local climate and soil conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, this study tests the usefulness of general equilibrium theory for validating these claims and draws similar conclusion. Subsequently, the model is readjusted to reflect simulation with two non-traditional policy options. This time, the results suggest that removing subsidies on fossil fuels would create opportunities provided that such is done in tandem with complementary policies. In particular, we show that a mix of 'agricultural productivity improvement' and a 'reduction in trade transaction costs' (at 15% in each case) would provide benefits for fossil fuel subsidies removal in Ghana. These results underscore the need for structural reforms in Ghanaian agricultural sector especially those aimed at promoting mechanized agriculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The heating and cooling of buildings account for a major share of the total primary energy consumption in Europe, and hence the energy policies should focus on this sector to achieve the greenhouse gas reduction targets set by international agreements. Geothermal heat pump is one of the least carbon-intensive technologies for the heating and cooling of buildings. It exploits the heat stored within the ground, a local renewable energy source which is widely available across the Alpine territory. Nevertheless, it has been little considered by European policies and cooperation projects. GRETA (near-surface Geothermal REsources in the Territory of the Alpine space) is a cooperation project funded by the EU INTERREG-Alpine Space program, aiming at demonstrating the potential of shallow geo-thermal energy and to foster its integration into energy planning instruments. It started in December 2015 and will last three years, involving 12 partners from Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.

How could we identify such goods? Which guidelines or guiding principles would guide our search? With what terms could we refer to the new category?APPROACHThe Economy for the Common Good (ECG) was formulated by Felber in 2010. We will develop our proposal within this general theoretical/reflexive framework. After synthesizing their core lines, we analyze their possible repercussions as a model of political economy and pay attention to their role as a vector for domesticating, eroding, and finally transcending the capitalist ways and practices and the serious imbalances it causes. We start from Communities for the Common Good, as civil society entities, that manage a small set of assets in community that assures them resilience: guaranteeing more autonomy, self-sufficiency and own initiative; at the same time as less dependence on other instances like market or State, with their unsecured wages or their subsidies. Resilience truly represents and constitutes the helm in advancing our purpose: communities for the common good must be unequivocally resilient communities.Common sense quickly gives us the list of indispensable goods, of which we daily face a massive and continuous consumption: housing, food, clothing, mobility and electric and internet access bills. We leave aside common sense pre-notions to proceed, as Bourdieu explains, to the epistemological break with which to be able to achieve them in a more rigorous and scientific way. We propose to approach this rupture through four ways:1. The sociohistorical way involves a journey through the Humanity's greatest socio-cultural transformations. It is a History of Great Changes within the evolution of human culture, paying attention to the goods that have had a vital and foundational character during the journey, marking each of the moments of transformation (discontinuities) between each historical or cultural continuity and its immediately subsequent. There are four discontinuities we identify as fundamental:a) the passage from Paleolithic to Neolithic, with the discovery of agriculture that made possible the first settlements, which we update operationally as homes or housing.b) the transition from Neolithic to complex societies (Mesopotamia, Nile Valley, Indus Valley) characterized by the incorporation of irrigation systems that multiplied agricultural production, forcing the need for a graphic system for accounting, which will later become more complex as a writing system.c) the passage from complex societies to industrial society. The large quantity and density of energy that allowed the massive and systematic use of fossil fuels and their ability to vectorize themselves to promote mobility play the same role as agriculture, housing and water distribution had played in the two previous discontinuities.d) the transition from industrial society to network society. A leap that is marked by the emergence of internet with all its potential in terms of massive intercommunication between peers in the network, revolutionizing the economic modes of production (3D printing) distribution (peer- topeer) and consumption (collaborative economy).The goods that have functioned as triggers of these great transformations, properly establishing themselves as the material conditions of possibility of these human realizations, currently provide the material conditions of human subsistence and dignity according to the civilizing paradigm that is taken into account as life context. On them lies resilience of civil society as such; when the communities of which it is composed are empowered with the control, leadership and management of these resources. Putting together all the stages studied we obtain six sectors, which for all above can be called foundational goods: housing, agroecology, water, energy, mobility and the internet.2. The economic path is another channel towards the new category that we aim to achieve. The broad field of commons. communal assets from ECG's perspective. is already consolidated after Elinor Ostrom's laureate works. We recognize its importance in setting up a format for community ownership. Civil economy and basic needs economy are theories that complete the essential axes to concretize the premises in order to justify the incorporation of civil society in the framework of the economic management modes. They can be called community goods: the asets to be managed through this type of community- based property.3. The political path begins with the awareness of the scarce institutionalization and functionality of civil society, to which is added the hitherto unknown knowledge of the role of communities in the whole of an Economy for the Common Good, as the subject on whom all possibility and responsibility for social or community resilience lies. When civil society organizes itself for the management of these goods, it elevates itself as the third pillar - along with the market and the State- of social order, expanding the space of political possibilities as it opens the door to governance relations. The main character to be enshrined by the new mode of management for the goods on which human dignity and subsistence depend, and hence its community resilience, is democracy. Now, from this perspective, we can call them democratic goods.4. The juridical way aims first to raise awareness of the relationship between the list of assets obtained by the development of previous channels of analysis and the realization of human rights, thus pointing to the establishment of economic rights. Secondly, he stresses the importance of extending to the economic order the division principle that separates the fundamental right from the ordinary one in the legal order. In this way, the goods grouped in the previous lines of reasoning could be called as fundamental goods, or rather, by the legal place that would correspond to them, constituent goods.RESULTS / IMPLICATIONSOf the four possibilities that we have obtained for its denomination, namely: foundational, communitarian, democratic and constituent, the attribute of "democratic" is the only one that is in permanent revision. At any historical moment, the modes of practical management of asets may undergo changes that enable or improve, for example, collective intelligence flow, due to advances in technology. In that case, the format used for its management should be updated so that it always coincides with the one that offers the highest levels of codecision, democracy and transparency of its time. This need for constant updating is the reason why we are finally inclined to preferentially denominate them as democratic goods, although the other three denominations are perfectly compatible and acceptable.To facilitate the understanding of the concept, we offer a first formulation of its definition, along with some other important features. Each of Galtung's basic needs - survival, welfare, freedom and identity-suggests a paired function among the goods we have found. The last step (identity) allows the incorporation of health and education, closing the complete scheme of democratic goods with eight sectors, as shown at the end, on the last page.PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS AND ORIGINAL VALUE The Economy for the Common Good contains two nuclei for practical work - communal goods and communities-that allow us to progress substantially towards a new concept for the establishment of economic rights as part of universal rights. Although Felber's manual does not initially envisage a specific structure or function of its own for the communities, nor does it specify a certain format for the management of communal assets, those are, clearly, the active subject that is to manage the minimum package of indispensable goods, which we have called democratic goods. Communal goods provide the type of general management - with a marked non-specific character, as Ostrom argued-that is viable for a community. It is through the most democratic mechanisms, such as self-consumption and cooperation structures oriented to basic needs - democratic goods cooperatives, very similar in their operations to consumers cooperatives-how communities gain resilience.The substitution of oligopolies by self-organized communities in the most indispensable sectors also offers a landscape of remarkable reduction of the total carbon footprint of our civilization. In the calculation of the economy's decarbonization both direct and indirect effects should be added.The political and economic repercussions of democratic goods, managed as such, are not restricted to the environment, but rather enter into the already abundant discussion of the inclusion of universal basic income in our economic systems. A kind of management like the one proposed with this new concept immerses us in the possibilities of a basic income in resources, without prejudice to a possible complementation in currency, also softening some of its classic points of friction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	5	18	0213-8093	1989-6816		WOS:000427095200008		J	Brockhaus, Maria; Korhonen-Kurki, Kaisa; Sehring, Jenniver; Di Gregorio, Monica; Assembe-Mvondo, Samuel; Babon, Andrea; Bekele, Melaku; Gebara, Maria Fernanda; Khatri, Dil Bahadur; Kambire, Hermann; Kengoum, Felicien; Kweka, Demetrius; Menton, Mary; Moeliono, Moira; Paudel, Naya Sharma; Thuy Thu Pham; Resosudarmo, Ida Aju Pradnja; Sitoe, Almeida; Wunder, Sven; Zida, Mathurin					Wunder, Sven/0000-0002-9422-0260; Brockhaus, Maria/0000-0001-7348-4921; Sitoe, Almeida/0000-0001-7583-2387; Moeliono, Moira/0000-0001-9055-6720; Sehring, Jenniver/0000-0002-0523-7256			REDD plus , transformational change and the promise of performance-based payments: a qualitative comparative analysis								CLIMATE POLICY				17	6			708	730						2017	2017	Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has emerged as a promising climate change mitigation mechanism in developing countries. This article examines the national political context in 13 REDD+ countries in order to identify the enabling conditions for achieving progress with the implementation of countries' REDD+ policies and measures. The analysis builds on a qualitative comparative analysis of various countries' progress with REDD+ conducted in 12 REDD+ countries in 2012, which highlighted the importance of factors such as already initiated policy change, and the presence of coalitions calling for broader policy change. A follow-up survey in 2014 was considered timely because the REDD+ policy arena, at the international and country levels, is highly dynamic and undergoes constant evolution, which affects progress with REDD+ policy-making and implementation. Furthermore, we will now examine whether the 'promise' of performance-based funds has played a role in enabling the establishment of REDD+. The results show a set of enabling conditions and characteristics of the policy process under which REDD+ policies can be established. The study finds that the existence of broader policy change, and availability of performance-based funding in combination with strong national ownership of the REDD+ policy process, may help guide other countries seeking to formulate REDD+ policies that are likely to deliver efficient, effective and equitable outcomes.Policy relevance Tropical forest countries struggle with the design and implementation of coherent policies and measures to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Evidence on which factors and configurations are crucial to make progress towards these challenging policy objectives will be helpful for decision makers and practitioners at all levels involved in REDD+. Key findings highlight the importance of already initiated policy change, and the availability of performance-based funding in combination with strong national ownership of the REDD+ process. These findings provide guidance to REDD+ countries as to which enabling conditions need to be strengthened to facilitate effective, efficient and equitable REDD+ policy formulation and implementation.									18	0	0	5	0	18	3	10	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000411385700002		S	Masera, Gabriele; Wakili, Karim Ghazi; Stahl, Thomas; Brunner, Samuel; Galliano, Rosanna; Monticelli, Carol; Aliprandi, Stefano; Zanelli, Alessandra; Elesawy, Amr				Samuel, Brunner/C-2880-2008; Gabriele Masera/K-7795-2015	Samuel, Brunner/0000-0001-5186-0308; Gabriele Masera/0000-0002-0704-4052	Ding, L; Fiorito, F; Osmond, P		Development of a super-insulating, aerogel-based textile wallpaper for the indoor energy retrofit of existing residential buildings								INTERNATIONAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE - A SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE 2016 SERIES (SBE16), IHBE 2016		Procedia Engineering		180				1139	1149		10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.274				2017	2017	Retrofitting the residential building stock poses a major challenge for the European building sector in the coming years. It is also crucial to achieve the decarbonisation goals set by the EU's Energy Roadmap 2050. The EASEE research project, funded by the European Commission, addressed this issue by developing a holistic approach to envelope retrofitting.This paper presents an innovative technical solution developed within this research project: a lightweight, aerogel-based wallpaper that can be easily installed on the inner side of perimeter walls. The system is composed of an aerogel-impregnated textile layer, forming the insulating core, and a fabric finishing that can be easily installed and replaced thanks to a bespoke tensioning device.The development of the system is explained starting from the identification of the challenges related to the application of an insulating layer to the internal face of an existing wall. These include building physics, as well as operational aspects to reduce disturbances of users. The insulating layer, based on a textile mat impregnated with aerogel, was tested and characterised at laboratory scale to ensure its high thermal performances and its permeability to water vapour. The fabric finishing system was also designed to provide the possibility of easy tensioning and disassembly for cleaning or replacement. An innovative device, based on plastic zips, was developed and patented within the project. As part of the process, specific studies were developed about cold bridges, thermal capacity and environmental impact of the system.The wallpaper was finally tested and monitored to assess its in-situ thermal performance and the assembly procedure on a building at Politecnico di Milano.

Many people, however, will not find the need for mitigation important enough to make their behavior more environmentally sustainable. Three studies supported the hypothesis that it is possible to overcome this issue by connecting these behaviors to goals that are important to people, even if such goals are unrelated to climate change or the environment in general. Study 1 (N = 305 working adults) showed that stronger self-concordance of behavior related to energy sustainability was related to a greater chance of signing a petition for increasing renewable energy sources. Next, 2 experimental studies (Study 2: N = 412 working and nonworking adults, and Study 3: N = 300 working adults) showed that increasing self-concordance of environmentally sustainable behaviors by asking people to cognitively connect either sustainable energy use (Study 2) or commuting behaviors (Study 3) to their personal goals increased intentions to engage in these behaviors compared to a control condition (Study 2 and Study 3) and compared to persuasion attempts based on climate change mitigation (Study 3). These findings occurred even after controlling for political orientation and environmental concerns. This research has significant practical implications for workplaces, particularly for those in which employees or managers place a low priority on environmental and climate change considerations.									6	0	0	1	0	6	5	105	0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000392104600005	27618410	J	Rakotovao, Narindra H.; Razafimbelo, Tantely M.; Rakotosamimanana, Stephan; Randrianasolo, Zafyson; Randriamalala, Josoa R.; Albrecht, Alain					Zafyson Hasina, RANDRIANASOLO/0000-0002-7957-4132			Carbon footprint of smallholder farms in Central Madagascar: The integration of agroecological practices								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				140				1165	1175		10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.045				JAN 1 2017	2017	The carbon footprint (CFP) assessment of smallholders offers key information on the capacities and challenges for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation at farm scale. This allows prioritizing the practices that ensure both the food security of farmers and the low carbon impact associated to climate change. To tackle food security challenges and to maintain sustainable environment production, agroecological practices were planned for farmers in the Itasy region, Central Highlands of Madagascar. The project consisted of agroforestry and forestry systems, composting of organic matters, and system of rice intensification. The goals of this study were (i) to assess the CFP of farms in the Itasy region Central Madagascar, (ii) to assess the impact of agroecological practices adopted by farmers on farms CFP, and (iii) to compare the impact of Tier 1 and Tier 3 factors for carbon removal in woody biomass and in cropland soils on farms CFP. For these purposes, a survey of 192 representative farms was realized during the years 2012-2013. Agroecological practices integrated at farm scale reduced significantly farms CFP up to 364% in terms of land surface and up to 578% in terms of food production, suggesting an important GHG sequestration at farm scale. Main sources of GHG at farms scale were: nitrous oxide from soil management (25%), methane from rice cultivation (24%), livestock manure management (24%), and enteric fermentation (23%). Trees planted in agroforestry and forestry systems offered the highest GHG mitigation benefits. Tier 1 factors overestimated up to 7 times higher the farms CFP compared to Tier 3 factors. This study highlights that the integration of agro-ecological practices at farm scale offers significant GHG mitigation and carbon sequestration in Malagasy context, thus giving an alternative for climate change mitigation.

Using Beijing as a case study, this article examines the extent to which neighborhood-scale urban form may contribute to reduction of travel-related CO2 emissions in the context of rapid urbanization and spatial transformation. We derive complete travel-activity records of 1,048 residents from an activity diary survey conducted in 2007. Analysis using structural equation models finds that residents living in a neighborhood with higher land use mix, public transit accessibility, and more pedestrian-friendly street design tend to travel in a "low-carbon" manner and emit less CO2 in daily travel, even controlling for residential and travel preferences. This article offers empirical evidence that sheds light on debates about policy measures to facilitate China's transition toward sustainable and low-carbon urban development.									14	0	0	2	0	14	8	60	0272-3638	1938-2847		WOS:000396759700011		S	Klein, Lurian; Matos, Luisa; Landeck, Jorge; Azevedo, Manuel; Vale, Zita; Basilio Simoes, J.

It was in this context that the NetEffiCity project - labelled as Community S - was envisioned, which aims at validating and demonstrating in a real environment the results of a previous R&D project, through the implementation of an integrated, smart and centralised energy sharing management platform adapted to two local pilot communities in Portugal, namely Penela and Alfandega da Fe. This solution includes automated energy monitoring and management tools and the aggregation of distributed generation from renewable energy sources in the energy sharing management, supported by advanced decision-making processes with learning capabilities, thus enabling new technological, business, environmental and social paradigms associated with the energy transition.In this way, the Community S project will provide the local energy community with the necessary tools for the development of a low-carbon economy, besides the efficient and shared use of energy resources, thus providing greater autonomy and boosting the resilience of local energy grids.					3rd Internacional Conference on Energy and Environment (ICEE) - Bringing Together Economics and Engineering3rd Internacional Conference on Energy and Environment (ICEE) - Bringing Together Economics and Engineering	JUN 29-30, 2017JUN 29-30, 2017	Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management; Univ Minho, Sch EngnUniv Porto, Sch Econ & Management; Univ Minho, Sch Engn	Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL	2	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	2183-3982		978-972-95396-9-5	WOS:000444802100097		S	Rani, Abha; Singh, Udayan; Jayant; Singh, Ajay K.; Mahapatra, Siba Sankar			IOP	Mahapatra, Siba Sankar/O-4447-2017; Singh, Udayan/L-1741-2019	Mahapatra, Siba Sankar/0000-0002-9733-4685; Singh, Udayan/0000-0003-3359-6296; Singh, Ajay K/0000-0001-5867-1120			Performance, cost and environmental assessment of gasification-based electricity in India: A preliminary analysis								WORKSHOP ON CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF UNDERGROUND COAL GASIFICATION IN INDIA (UCG-2017)		IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		76						UNSP 012007	10.1088/1755-1315/76/1/012007				2017	2017	Coal gasification processes are crucial to decarbonisation in the power sector. While underground coal gasification (UCG) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) are different in terms of the site of gasification, they have considerable similarities in terms of the types of gasifiers used. Of course, UCG offers some additional advantages such as reduction of the fugitive methane emissions accompanying the coal mining process. Nevertheless, simulation of IGCC plants involving surface coal gasification is likely to give reasonable indication of the 3E (efficiency, economics and emissions) prospects of the gasification pathway towards electricity. This paper will aim at Estimating 3E impacts (efficiency, environment, economics) of gasification processes using simulation carried out in the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) software framework. Key plant level controls which will be studied in this paper will be based on Indian financial regulations and operating costs which are specific to the country. Also, impacts of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in these plants will be studied. The various parameters that can be studied are plant load factor, impact of coal quality and price, type of CO2 capture process, capital costs etc. It is hoped that relevant insights into electricity generation from gasification may be obtained with this paper.

Moreover, regardless of the various developments in science and technology, there are still uncertainties regarding the precise extent and consequences of climate change. Additionally, financial resources to support climate change mitigation, adaptation and capacity building programmes in Africa may be considered to be far from satisfactory in terms of their size, source and distribution. Global policymakers are therefore keen to discover how climate finance resources can be mobilised from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels to complement public sources. To address this knowledge gap, this paper undertook an analysis of project reports, policy reviews, policy briefs, and academic literature reviews on the barriers and opportunities for private investments in climate change programmes. The paper highlights that Sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to mobilise over US $100 billion annually from its diaspora population, and these funds can be channelled towards climate change investments and programmes or leveraged with other conventional climate finance modalities. This paper therefore provides insights into the measures that can be undertaken in order to enable Africa's diaspora to become important financiers of climate change programmes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2372-0344	2372-0352		WOS:000432595000001		S	Hwang, Ki-Ha; Park, No-Eon; Kim, Ka-young						Cingula, M; Przygoda, M; Detelj, K		DIRECTION AND CRITERIA OF KOREA'S GOVERNMENT R&D INVESTMENT FOR RESPONDING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN FY 2018								ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD 2017)		International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development						120	127						2017	2017	Climate change due to global warming is one of the hottest global issues and has become more important since the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change. The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts. Moon Jae-in government, which was launched in May, declared an environment-friendly energy policy with a focus on expanding renewable energy. Also, in order to respond proactively to the global issue of climate change, the government of the Republic of Korea is constantly striving to strengthen its national science and technology capacity. In this paper, we introduce the change of environment and energy technology policy which is the core of responding to climate change, and the investment direction of national R&D in Korea. The total amount of government R&D investment in the environment and energy sector in FY 2015 was $2.07 billion (1.9% increase from the previous year) which the investment in the power generation sector was high, 25.7% of renewable energy, 19.3% of nuclear power and 10.3% of electric power respectively. According to the energy policy paradigm of the new government, the share of renewable energy and gas power generation is increasing but the share of nuclear and coal-fired thermal power generation is decreasing in the energy mix. The government is focusing on core technologies for climate change response that are in line with R&D on GHG(greenhouse gas) reduction and utilization. And, Currently, R&D on environment and energy sector is continuously increasing. Especially, to improve investment efficiency and effectiveness with limited resources, strategic selection and concentration are needed to develop greenhouse gas reduction technologies and foster related industries and markets.					23rd International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development (ESD)23rd International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development (ESD)	SEP 15-16, 2017SEP 15-16, 2017	Varazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ N; Univ Warsaw, Fac ManagementVarazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ N; Univ Warsaw, Fac Management	Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1849-7535		*****************	WOS:000427987300013		S	Sunyowati, Dina; Vinata, Ria Tri						Iswati; Maruf, A; Sunyowati, D; Sutirto, IN		Blue Carbon: The Role Of The Ocean As A Climate Balance In The Mitigation Of Climate Change								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL OF UNIVERSITAS AIRLANGGA: IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT TO MEET SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (ICPSUAS 2017)		Advances in Social Science Education and Humanities Research		98				149	152						2017	2017	The impact of global climate change has been a particular concern of the world community and nations, including Indonesia. As an archipelagic country that has a wide range of natural resources and high biodiversity, Indonesia has great potential to be adversely affected by climate change and also has great potential to contribute in its mitigation and adaptation to its negative impacts. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets out several targets for reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the context of climate change mitigation. Blue carbon in Indonesia is stored in the marine environment and has great potential as an absorber or hoarder of carbon dioxide that can reduce GHG emissions. Indonesia's coastal and marine areas have the potential to absorb approximately 138 million tonnes of carbon equivalent per year or five times more than the potential absorption of tropical forest ecosystems in Indonesia. The carbon sequestration potential can reduce 25% of global carbon emissions. The amount of carbon storage shows that the ocean can play an important role in climate change mitigation. However, the complexity of blue carbon management and its implementation capacity still requires in-depth study. The analysis in this paper uses a form of normative legal research, which is done by analyzing related laws and regulations, using a problem statute approach and conceptual approach. Legal construction in the management of blue carbon is required as a form of protection of the marine environment as a climate balancer.					1st International Conference of Postgraduate-School-of-Universitas-Airlangga (ICPSUAS) - Implementation of Climate Change Agreement to Meet Sustainable Development Goals1st International Conference of Postgraduate-School-of-Universitas-Airlangga (ICPSUAS) - Implementation of Climate Change Agreement to Meet Sustainable Development Goals	AUG 01-02, 2017AUG 01-02, 2017		Univ Airlangga, Postgraduate Sch, Surabaya, INDONESIAUniv Airlangga, Postgraduate Sch, Surabaya, INDONESIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	4	2352-5398		978-94-6252-461-3	WOS:000426718600033		S	Vinnichenko, Varvara; Ryazanov, Alexander						Vatulia, G; Plugin, A; Darenskyi, O		Ecological indices of manufacture of Portland cement clinker and production of the dolomite clinker								6TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY OF RAILWAY TRANSPORT ENGINEERING STRUCTURES AND BUILDINGS (TRANSBUD-2017)		MATEC Web of Conferences		116						UNSP 01020	10.1051/matecconf/201711601020				2017	2017	It is shown that the production of dolomite clinker in comparison with that of Portland cement is environmentally appropriate. When calcining dolomite for cementitious binder, the pollution of the atmosphere by carbon dioxide is reduced due to its isolation during decarbonization reactions of calcium carbonates. Reducing fuel consumption for clinker burning provides less carbon dioxide emissions from combustion products. Reducing the firing temperature creates obstacles to the formation of nitrogen oxides.

To move towards to climate change mitigation there are necessity for methodology where are calculated carbon dioxide capacity in bioproduct. Methodology consists of five modules where (1) need to estimate bioresource quality, (2) need to calculate stored CO2 emissions in bioproduct, (3) need to evaluate bioproduct eco-design, (4) need to calculate in product production emitted CO2 emissions and (5) need to calculate total CO2 emissions.

Mixed-approach content analysis of a sample of 100 Chilean digital press articles relating to NCRE, using the analytical framework of Niklas Luhmann's Social Systems Theory. Results and Discussion. The predominance of solar and wind sources goes hand in hand with a low terminological clarity, which however allows mass media to build distinct thematic structures around social systems such as economy, science, politics and law. Environmental references are less frequent and shallower, privileging its evocative aspects with maximum linkage capacity. Conclusions. Instead than observing mass media as mere transmitters of rationalities external to them, more attention should be given to their ability to create realities and representing the (human and ecological) environment.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	3	1138-5820			WOS:000425209800001		J	Ghaffarian, Elham; Ghaffarian, Azizeh; Hasheminasab, Mohsen								Project-oriented financing and climate change mitigation planning in developing countries								UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				7	4			111	115		10.15421/2017_93				2017	2017	We considered the environment as a natural source and initial and basic foundation of investment for modern societies and developed countries from economic, political and social concern. In all countries, the quality of environment is of great importance and subject of management activity. We suggested that developed countries for the reason of dynamic economy and having economic actors by friendly improvement on substructures of environment overcomes to decrease of unnatural process in climate change is a problem and mental disturbance of all counties, so cooperation on political, legal and economical aspect with developing countries is considered one of the obligations of today world. Numerous international contracts and conventions are of great importance in terms of the cooperation between the states for the recognition and decrease of climate change, but it is not enough. We supposed the modern disasters caused by climate change should be essential need to change of substructures in societies, whereas the developing countries are rather unable to invest in this field and meet these challenges. We came to conclusion that developed countries as the investors need frequently use the project-oriented financial security for providing the management plans to decrease climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	2520-2138			WOS:000419834300015		S	Gastine, M.; Berenblyum, R.; Czernichowski-Lauriol, I.; de Dios, J.

Onshore storage offers increased flexibility and reduced infrastructure and monitoring costs. Enabling onshore storage will support management of decarbonisation strategies at territory level while enhancing security of energy supply and local economic activities, and securing jobs across Europe. However, successful onshore storage also requires overcoming some unique technical and societal challenges. ENOS will provide crucial advances to help foster onshore CO2 storage across Europe through:1. Developing, testing and demonstrating in the field, under "real-life conditions", key technologies specifically adapted to onshore storage.2. Contributing to the creation of a favourable environment for onshore storage across Europe.The ENOS site portfolio will provide a great opportunity for demonstration of technologies for safe and environmentally sound storage at relevant scale. Best practices will be developed using experience gained from the field experiments with the participation of local stakeholders and the lay public. This will produce improved integrated research outcomes and increase stakeholder understanding and confidence in CO2 storage. In this improved framework, ENOS will catalyse new onshore pilot and demonstration projects in new locations and geological settings across Europe, taking into account the site-specific and local socio-economic context. By developing technologies from TRL4/5 to TRL6 across the storage lifecycle, feeding the resultant knowledge and experience into training and education and cooperating at the pan-European and global level, ENOS will have a decisive impact on innovation and build the confidence needed for enabling onshore CO2 storage in Europe.ENOS is initiating strong international collaboration between European researchers and their counterparts from the USA, Canada, South Korea, Australia and South Africa for sharing experience worldwide based on real-life onshore pilots and field experiments. Fostering experience-sharing and research alignment between existing sites is key to maximise the investment made at individual sites and to support the efficient large scale deployment of CCS. ENOS is striving to promote collaboration between sites in the world through a programme of site twinning, focus groups centered around operative issues and the creation of a leakage simulation alliance.

Universities are not exempt from this challenge and are operating in a complex external environment, not least responding to the UK government's Climate Change Act 2008 (80% carbon reductions by 2050 as per 1990 baseline). In 2012-2013, the UK Higher Education (HE) sector consumed 7.9 billion kWh of energy and produced 2.3 million tonnes of carbon emissions. This indicates the scale of the challenge and carbon management is central to reduce carbon emissions. However, effective processes for implementing and embedding carbon management in organizations in general, and universities in particular, have yet to be realized. This paper explores the critical success factors (CSFs) for embedding carbon management in universities and, more widely, in organizations. This exploratory study adopted a mixed-methods approach including the content analysis of universities' carbon management plans alongside semi-structured interviews in the UK HE sector. The paper identifies six key factors for successfully embedding carbon management that are pertinent not just for the HE sector, but to organizations broadly: senior management leadership; funding and resources; stakeholder engagement; planning; governance and management; and evaluation and reporting.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	3	1758-3004	1758-3012		WOS:000418842800003		S	Schmidt, Monique; Crawford, Robert H.

However, current focus has mainly been on reducing operational GHGE leaving building embodied GHGE (i.e. the GHG emissions associated with the extraction, manufacture and transportation of materials, and the building construction process itself) largely ignored. These embodied emissions have been estimated to represent between 10% to 97% of a buildings total life cycle GHGE. It is thus critical that decision-making in relation to buildings is based on a life cycle perspective. One of the main barriers to this approach is the uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of life cycle GHGE reduction strategies. Despite project cost being a key driver for decision-making, building developers, designers and owners have insufficient knowledge or appropriate tools to adequately consider these life cycle costs and balance them against GHGE savings. Several methods exist for quantifying the costs of a building, such as life cycle costing (LCC). However, LCC and life cycle GHGE assessments are often used in isolation. This study will address the urgent need to move towards integrating these assessments by developing a framework that can be used to ascertain the important relationships and trade-offs between financial and GHGE performance of various building-related GHGE reduction strategies. This framework can be used as part of the building decision-making process and help create a low carbon, affordable built environment. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this paper, we analyzed the effect of long-term operation of petrochemical equipment of unalloyed and low-alloyed steel at climatic temperatures in technological environments containing hydrogen sulfide on the degradation of the structure of this equipment. We have carried out calculations of carbon diffusion to the surface during decarburization, indicating a clear possibility of diffusion fluxes of interstitial elements occurring under climatic temperatures and long exposures. The paper presents data on the structure and technological precipitation of equipment components after long-term operation (30 years or more) in oil refineries. We have carried out calculations of carbon diffusion to the surface during decarburization, indicating a clear possibility of diffusion fluxes of interstitial elements occurring under climatic temperatures and long exposures. The reason for decarburization during operation in an environment containing hydrogen sulfide, in this case, should not be attributed to hydrogen corrosion, but to an oxide layer forming due to the presence of condensate and water vapor.			Анализ состояния материала объектов нефтехимической промышленности в связи с их длительной эксплуатацией крайне важен для оценки их безопасности и работоспособности.

Приводятся данные исследования структуры и технологических отложений элементов оборудования после длительной (30 и более лет) эксплуатации на предприятиях нефтепереработки. Выполнены расчеты диффузии углерода к поверхности при обезуглероживании, которые указывают на явную возможность протекания при климатических температурах и длительных выдержках диффузионных потоков элементов внедрения. Причину обезуглероживания при работе в среде, содержащей сероводород, в данном случае следует связывать не с водородной коррозией, а с образованием оксидного слоя вследствие наличия конденсата и паров воды.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2542-1239			RSCI:29819969		J	Kono, Daniel Yuichi								Tariffs and Carbon Emissions								INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS				43	6			895	919		10.1080/03050629.2017.1311257				2017	2017	International trade and the environment are uneasy partners. Both environmentalists and free traders worry that the pursuit of one goal may obstruct the other. Nowhere is this tension more evident than in the area of climate change. Does trade liberalization increase carbon emissions? Do efforts to reduce carbon emissions lead to protectionist pressures? This paper addresses these questions by examining the relationship between CO2 emissions and tariffs in 109 to 153 countries from 1988 to 2013. Using instrumental-variable regressions to address reciprocal causation, I find that emissions reductions led to higher tariffs on manufactured goods. This suggests that carbon-intensive industries responded to carbon restrictions by lobbying against trade liberalization. In contrast, emissions did not affect tariffs on less carbon-intensive primary products, and neither type of tariff affected CO2 emissions. My results imply that efforts to combat climate change may obstruct trade liberalization, but the latter should not hinder climate change mitigation.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1	3	0305-0629	1547-7444		WOS:000415642800001		S	Aanuoluwapo, Oguntona Olusegun; Ohis, Aigbavboa Clinton					OGUNTONA, OLUSEGUN/0000-0001-8963-8796	Yan, J; Sun, F; Chou, SK; Desideri, U; Li, H; Campana, P; Xiong, R		Biomimetic strategies for climate change mitigation in the built environment								8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ENERGY (ICAE2016)		Energy Procedia		105				3868	3875		10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.792				2017	2017	Out of the numerous challenges facing mankind globally, the impact of climate change poses more threat. These impacts includesea-level rise, more frequent floods from heavy rainfall and notably among others, intense droughts. Despite the United Nations anchored events and conferences geared towards tackling climate change, little success has been recorded till date. Biomimicry, a novel science and method that studies nature's models and then emulates their forms, processes, and strategies offer a sustainable approach to this menace of climate change. It also has the potential to offer efficient alternatives to the human activities that contribute to the depletion and pollution of the environment. Hence, the objective of this paper is to evaluate and present the potential of biomimicry in for climate change mitigation in the built environment. An extant literature review was conducted on biomimicry and its roles in tackling climate change through mitigation and adaptation. The result explores various Biomimetic innovations and applications with their potential to sustainably mitigate the menace of climate change if adopted. This study is expected to refocus human efforts towards biomimicry where it is believed that nature, during its 3.8 billion years of existence has evolved with highly efficient processes and systems, with the potential to produce solutions to the environmental challenges facing mankind, especially climate change.(C) 2017 The Authors.

This brief analysis estimates the potential climate ramifications of changing US leadership, contrasting the Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization (MCS) released under the Obama Administration, with campaign statements, early executive actions, and prevailing market conditions to estimate potential emission pathways under the Trump Administration. The analysis highlights areas where GHG reductions are less robust to changing policy conditions, and offers brief recommendations for addressing emissions in the interim. It specifically finds that continued reductions in the electricity sector are less vulnerable to changes in federal policy than those in the built environment and land use sectors. Given the long-lived nature of investments in these latter two sectors, however, opportunities for near-term climate action by willing cities, states, private landowners, and non-profit organizations warrant renewed attention in this time of climate uncertainty.Key policy insightsThe recent US presidential election has already impacted mitigation goals and practices, injecting considerable uncertainty into domestic and international efforts to address climate change.A strategic assessment issued in the final days of the Obama Administration for how to reach long-term climate mitigation objectives provides a baseline from which to gauge potential changes under the Trump Administration.Though market trends may continue to foster emission declines in the energy sector, emission reductions in the land use sector and the built environment are subject to considerable uncertainty.Regardless of actions to scale back climate mitigation efforts, US emissions are likely to be flat in the coming years. Assuming that emissions remain constant under President Trump and that reductions resume afterwards to meet the Obama Administration mid-century targets in 2050, this near-term pause in reductions yields a difference in total emissions equivalent to 0.3-0.6 years of additional global greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the number of terms served by a Trump Administration.									12	0	0	1	0	12	1	10	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000413767700008		J	Olander, Mona Holmqvist; Olander, Clas				Holmqvist, Mona/Q-2194-2015; Olander, Clas/Q-2209-2015	Holmqvist, Mona/0000-0002-8734-1224; Olander, Clas/0000-0003-4463-2707			Understandings of climate change articulated by Swedish secondary school students								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION				51	4			349	357		10.1080/00219266.2016.1233130				2017	2017	This study investigated beliefs about climate change among Swedish secondary school students at the end of their K-12 education. An embedded mixed method approach was used to analyse 51 secondary school students' written responses to two questions: (1) What implies climate change? (2) What affects climate? A quantitative analysis of the responses revealed that Earth', human' and greenhouse effect' were frequent topics regarding the first question, and pollution', atmosphere' and Earth' were frequent regarding the second. A qualitative analysis, based on a conceptual elements' framework, focused on three elements within responses: atmosphere (causes and/or consequences), Earth (causes and consequences) and living beings (humans and/or animals and their impacts on climate change). It revealed a predominantly general or societal, rather than individual, perspective underlying students' responses to the second question. The ability to connect general/societal issues with individual issues relating to climate change could prompt students to reflect on the contributions of individuals towards climate change mitigation, thereby constituting a basis for decision-making to promote a sustainable environment. Although the students did not discuss climate changes from an individual perspective, their statements revealed their understanding of climate change as a system comprising various components affecting the overall situation. They also revealed an understanding of the difference between weather and climate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0021-9266	2157-6009		WOS:000414081700004		J	박경진								Life Cycle Assessment Based Analysis of the Environmental Features of Means of Transportation: Focused on Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Honam High-Speed Railway			전과정평가(LCA)에 기반한 교통수단의 환경성 분석: 호남고속철도의 온실가스 배출을 중심으로					Journal of Environmental Policy and Administration	환경정책			25	3			71	94		10.15301/jepa.2017.25.3.71				2017	2017	The economic efficiency of the Honam High-Speed Railway emerged as a core issue when a feasibility study revealed there was no profitability in the project. The controversy surrounding this economic efficiency was deepened by the 1997 IMF crisis.Such controversy reflects a policy process that has not yet been synchronized with the policies of climate change initiatives and domestic greenhouse gas reduction policies that the international community has been ambitiously pursuing in recent years. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the opening of the Honam High Speed Railway is worthy as an eco-friendly means of transportation to cope with climate change, through analysis of the environmental features of the means of transportation that run along the Honam axis.Simplified Life Cycle Assessment was used as an analytical tool to examine the greenhouse gas emissions of the passenger segment under operation. The result of the analysis showed that it is a desirable means of transportation in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.Based on the results of this research, the policy implications for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, considering climate, energy and environment, are as follows. First, it is a policy of power consumption reduction, to reduce energy consumption by operating the high-speed railway. Second, it should be accompanied by energy diversification policy, such as improving the efficiency of the power generation mix with technological innovation for power deoxygenation and expanding the supply of new energy. Lastly, it contributes to the improvement of the transportation environment and supply of eco-friendly vehicles considering the distance traveled. It is suggested that traffic demand management measures are also needed to make the environment-friendly traffic policy acceptable as described above.				호남고속철도는 타당성 조사에서부터 사업성이 없는 것으로 나타나 경제성 문제가 핵심이슈로 등장하였으며, 1997년에는 IMF 외환위기까지 발생하여 경제성에 따른 논란이 심화되었다. 이 같은 논란은 최근국제사회가 야심차게 추진하고 있는 기후변화 이니셔티브의 정책기조와 국내 온실가스 감축 정책과는 동조화되지 못하는 정책과정이었다고 할 수 있다. 이에 본 연구에서는 호남고속철도개통이 기후변화에 대응한친환경 교통수단으로서 가치가 있는지에 대해 호남축을 운행하는 교통수단 간 환경성 분석을 통하여 검토하고 있다. 분석도구로는 간략전과정평가(S-LCA)를 활용하여, 운행 중인 여객 부문의 온실가스 배출량을 살펴보았다. 연구 결과 온실가스 배출 측면에서는 바람직한 교통수단으로 밝혀졌었다. 이 같은 연구결과를 토대로 기후･에너지･환경을 고려한 교통부문의 온실가스 감축을 위한 정책적 함의로는 첫째, 고속철도 운행시 에너지 소비 절감을 위한 전력소비량 감소 정책, 둘째, 전력 탈탄소를 위한 기술혁신으로 발전 믹스의 효율화 제고 및 신생에너지의 공급 확대 등 에너지 다변화 정책, 셋째, 운행거리를 고려한 친환경 차량 보급 및교통여건 개선으로 수용가능한 환경 친화적인 교통정책이 되도록 하는 교통수요관리대책이 필요함을 제안하고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	1598-835X			KJD:ART002272462		J	문승민								Does Korea's Aid for Mitigating Climate Change Contribute to the Reduction of CO2 emissions in the Recipient Countries? : Focusing on the Environmental Kuznets			한국의 기후변화 완화 원조는 수원국의 이산화탄소배출 감축에 기여하는가?: 환경 쿠즈네츠 곡선과거버넌스의 관점을 중심으로					International Development and Cooperation Review	국제개발협력연구			9	2			29	56						2017	2017	Korea is trying to expand the quantity and quality of aid for mitigating climate change to cope with the new climate regime. However, indiscriminate aid, which does not consider its effectiveness, can lead to failure. In this regard, this study aims to empirically investigate the effect of Korea's aid for mitigating climate change on the reduction of CO2 emissions in the recipient countries. In addition, this also aims to provide implications for the future direction of Korea's aid for mitigating climate change by examining the effect of the economic or governance environment of the recipient countries on effectiveness of aid.The analyzed results showed that Korea's aid for mitigating climate change has an effect on CO2 reduction in the recipient countries and it has a more positive effect on CO2 reduction when providing aid by considering the governance of the recipient countries. These results suggest that governance of the recipients should be considered in order to secure effectiveness of aid in promoting aid for mitigating climate change in the future.				우리나라는 신 기후체제에 대비하기 위해 기후변화 원조의 양과 질을 확대하고자 한다. 그러나효과성을 고려하지 않은 무분별한 원조는 실패로 이어질 수 있다. 이러한 점에서 본 연구는 우리나라 기후변화 완화 원조가 수원국의 이산화탄소 배출 감축에 미치는 영향을 실증적으로 규명하고자 하였다. 또한 수원국의 경제적 또는 거버넌스 환경이 원조의 효과성에 미치는 영향을 살펴봄으로써 향후 우리나라의 기후변화 원조 방향에 대한 함의를 제공하고자 한다. 분석결과 우리나라의 기후변화 완화 원조는 수원국의 이산화탄소 감축에 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났으며, 수원국의 거버넌스를 고려하여 제공할 때 이산화탄소 감축에 더욱 긍정적인 것으로 밝혀졌다. 이러한 결과는 향후 기후변화 완화 원조를 추진함에 원조의 효과성을 담보하기 위해서는 수원국의 거버넌스를 고려해야함을 시사한다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2005-9620			KJD:ART002252885		J	Ali, Qamar; Khan, Muhammad Tariq Iqbal; Ashfaq, Muhammad				Ali, Qamar/J-3737-2019				Greenhouse Gas Reduction in Off-Season Cucumber Production by Improving Energy Efficiency: A Case Study from Punjab, Pakistan								POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES				26	4			1453	1460		10.15244/pjoes/68179				2017	2017	Approximately 10 to 12% of GHG emissions come from the agricultural sector. Consumption of energy in agriculture is a source of GHG and it can be decreased by efficient utilization of energy inputs. Therefore, our present research calculated energy efficiencies (for technical, pure technical, and scale) and extent of GHG reduction after benchmarking an inefficient farm in off-season cucumber production in Punjab, Pakistan. Primary data were collected from 70 farmers with simple random sampling. Average technical efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE), and scale efficiency (SE) were 0.77, 0.91, and 0.85, respectively, while increasing (IRS) and constant (CRS) return to scale were observed in 46 and 24 farms, respectively. The decrease in total input energy was 33,908.00 MJ ha(-1) (14.14%) if inefficient farmers use the energy inputs according to recommendations. A large share of energy savings comes from fertilizers (63.66%), followed by diesel (25.88%), plastic (5.78%), chemicals (2.69%), water (1.06%), labour (0.50%), and machinery (0.44%). Total GHG reduction was 1,004.68 kg CO2 eq.ha(-1) (17.75%) after improvement in energy efficiency. Agricultural extension staff should visit the vegetable farms on a regular basis and give necessary information about efficient utilization of energy inputs. In addition, the government should promote renewable sources of energy due to their environmentally friendly behavior.									1	0	0	1	0	1	0	7	1230-1485	2083-5906		WOS:000408078000003		S	Lah, Oliver						Ulengin, F; Li, K; Boltze, M		Factors of Change: The influence of policy environment factors on climate change mitigation strategies in the transport sector								WORLD CONFERENCE ON TRANSPORT RESEARCH - WCTR 2016		Transportation Research Procedia		25				3499	3514		10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.265				2017	2017	There is a large potential for cost-effective solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve the sustainability of the transport sector that is yet unexploited. Considering the cost-effectiveness and the potential for co-benefits, it is hard to understand why energy gains and mitigation action in the transport sector is still lagging behind the potential. Particularly interesting is the fact that there is substantial difference among countries with relatively similar economic performances, such as the OECD countries in the development of their transport CO2 emission over the past thirty years despite the fact that these countries had relatively similar access to efficient technologies and vehicles. This study aims to apply some well established political science theories on the particular example of climate change mitigation in the transport sector in order to identify some of the factors that could help explain the variations in success of policies and strategies in this sector. The analysis suggests that institutional arrangements that contribute to consensus building in the political process provide a high level of political and policy stability which is vital to long-term changes in energy end-use sectors that rely on long-term investments. However, there is no direct correlation between institutional structures, e.g. corporatism and success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Environmental objectives need to be built into the consensus-based policy structure before actual policy progress can be observed. This usually takes longer in consensus democracies than in politically more agile majoritarian policy environments, but the policy stability that builds on corporatist institutional structures is likely to experience changes over a longer-term, in this case to a shift towards low-carbon transport that endures.

Many scientific studies have confirmed the relationship between the emission of greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide and global climate change. Reducing the emission of greenhouse gas is an effective way to solve the problem of climate change. This paper presents a new method for reducing carbon emissions: using the photosynthesis of plants to achieve carbon fixation in plant factory. In order to verify the feasibility of this method, we built a closed artificial light plant factory adopting LED lighting to conduct the experiment of carbon dioxide enrichment. The results shows that the production of the plants increased by 20%-25% and the plants fixed a considerable amount of carbon dioxide by increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment to 1000 ppm.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector contribute to 3% of total anthropogenic emissions. In this study, applicable solutions for municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Luangprabang (LPB) and Laos were examined. Material flow analysis of MSW was performed to estimate the amount of MSW generated in 2015. Approximately 29,419 tonnes of MSW is estimated for 2015. Unmanaged landfilling was the main disposal method, while MSW open burning was also practiced to some extent. The International Panel on Climate Change 2006 model and the Atmospheric Brown Clouds Emission Inventory Manual were used to estimate GHG emissions from existing MSW management, and total emissions are 33,889 tonnes/year carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-eq). Three scenarios were developed in order to reduce GHG emissions and environmental problems. Improvement of the MSW management by expanding MSW collection services, introducing composting and recycling, and avoiding open burning, can be considered as solutions to overcome the problems for LPB. The lowest GHG emissions are achieved in the scenario where composting and recycling are proposed, with the total GHG emissions reduction by 18,264 tonnes/year CO2-eq.									3	0	0	2	0	3	1	9	0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000403391500006	28278091	S	Shezan, S.

Power distribution and continuous fuel transportation to produce the electrical energy for these areas pretences a great challenge. A smart-grid hybrid energy system has been designed and simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 34 kWh/d and peak load of 4.6 kW. The total simulation and optimization process of the hybrid energy system have been done by HOMER Software with the meteorological data. The simulation results ensure that the proposed system is economically and environmentally feasible. The results show that Net Present Cost (NPC) and CO2 emission can be reduced about 29.65% per year compared to the conventional power plants. The NPC of the optimized system has been found about US$ 33,310.00 having the Cost of Energy (COE) about US$ 0.209/kWh. This analysed hybrid system will be applicable for similar meteorological and environmental conditions. This analysed hybrid system will be applicable for similar meteorological and environmental conditions. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 meters (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill, Brisbane, Australia. Using renewable energy resources in off grid hybrid energy system might be a solution of this issue. Moreover, high cost of renewable energy systems has led to its slow adoption in many countries. Hence, it is vital to select an appropriate size of the system in order to reduce the cost and excess energy produced as well as to maximize the available resources. Reduction of some greenhouse gasses as well as reduction of per unit cost according to the market price are main contribution of this research. The analysed hybrid solar-wind-diesel renewable energy system will be the most feasible and environment friendly in comparison with other traditional or conventional energy sources in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness.

Multiple projects and methodologies are published every day but neither of them with the holistic approach that will assure complete success since the design phase. This stock is never considered as a whole. Its components are installed, serviced and maintained by different companies and in different stages without a holistic approach to the overall building operation. The result is a lack of energy efficiency and feedback of the solutions implemented once the buildings are refurbished. Nevertheless, existing buildings play a key role in the achievement of the ambitious energy saving and greenhouse gas reduction targets that Europe has fixed for 2020 and 2050. Research has demonstrated that the impact in terms of decrease of energy use and CO2 will be strong, considering that, in Europe, 80% of the 2030 building stock already exists and 30% are historical buildings. To achieve these goals, reliable data about energy consumption, building components and systems performance of the existing building stock is needed.This paper presents a pre-assessment methodology to tackle the energy retrofitting of historic and existing residential buildings based on the Maturity Matrix Assessment. The maturity of the implementation of energy efficiency measures in Brussels historic residential stock is evaluated to determine future appropriate implementations. The matrix synthetizes appropriate strategies for this specific stock and provides a global map of the problematic, requirements and solutions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The implementation of a sustainable transportation environment through EV utilization, however, requires the addressing of certain cost and environmental concerns such as limited driving range and battery-charging issues before its full potential can be realized. Nevertheless, a specific type of use of EVs, namely in taxi services, may elicit positive public opinion, as it promises a commitment toward sustainability in urban life. In light of this, this study proposes an integrated approach that combines EV operation with a conceptual design for shared-ride taxi services. As some productivity loss may be naturally expected due to the time spent in charging, it is important to look at whether such performance loss from the passenger and system standpoints can be offset with ingenuity in operational design. In this study, an EV taxi charge-replenishing scheme that can be coupled with a real-time taxi-dispatch algorithm is designed. The proposed EV charging schemes for taxi services are studied via simulations and the effects of the limited driving range and battery-charging details are examined from a system performance viewpoint. The simulation study also reveals illustrative results on the impact of the EV taxi fleet's operation on the charging system. Next, a real-time shared-taxi operation scheme that allows ride sharing with other passengers is proposed to maximize the operational efficiency. The simulation results suggest that the shared-taxi concept can be a viable option to improve on the limitations caused by EV operation. In addition, the importance of projected charging demands and queue delays at different charging locations are also addressed. Some limitations and a future research agenda are also discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	7	5	32	1556-8318	1556-8334		WOS:000400663000002		J	이순자								Legal Trend and Issues in the Atmospheric Environment			대기 환경분야의 최근동향과 쟁점					Environmental Law and Policy	환경법과 정책			18				59	94		10.18215/envlp.18..201702.59				2017	2017	Over recent years, the increase in fine dust has resulted in deteriorating health and discomfort in life, and efforts have been made to implement greenhouse gas reductions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In addition, as the Paris Convention entered into force on November 4, 2016, there occurred the obligation to reduce GHG emissions. For these reasons, there arose a lot of trends and issues about GHG linked to fine dust and climate change in the 2000s' atmospheric environment sector. The amendments to the Clean Air Conservation Act also centered on countermeasures against fine dust, automobile emissions and GHG reductions.In this paper, I reviews the amendments of the laws related to fine dust and climate change, and the cases involved to the atmospheric environment after 2011, from the year 2011 to the beginning of February 2017.In Ⅲ, I reviewed newly established or amended regulations against the existing Clean Air Preservation Act.

However, asking households to reduce deforestation means asking them to sacrifice direct benefits from forests, such as energy resources. The REDD+ programme provides a way to compensate households. This study estimates households' willingness to accept forest-use restrictions governing participation in the REDD+ programme and its determinants. The results show that households would participate in REDD+ if the programme were to compensate them with an average of USD 2072 per year. The determinants of willingness to participate are analysed using the Heckman sample selection model. The results reveal that awareness about REDD+ economic incentives, and that deforestation and forest degradation is not good for the environment, and the increased time spent collecting the most important forest products increased probability of household participation. Households that earned more from forest products demanded greater compensation to participate. The results further revealed that, once a household is aware of the programme and its incentives and decides to participate, it tended to demand less compensation. The Government of Tanzania is advised to (i) collect baseline data in order to differentiate incentives for households depending on their forest reliance, (ii) educate people about the relationship between REDD+ and climate change to increase the cooperation of the communities.									4	0	0	2	0	4	0	4	1756-5529	1756-5537		WOS:000396844200005		J	Kahler, Miles								Domestic Sources of Transnational Climate Governance								INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS				43	1	SI		156	174		10.1080/03050629.2017.1251687				JAN-MAR 2017	2017	Transnational climate governance (TCG) is an example of complex governance in which national governments no longer serve as reliable gatekeepers between nonstate and subnational actors and global governance. The articles in this special issue demonstrate that TCG and complex governance do not eliminate the importance of domestic political institutions and actors in explaining national variation in engagement with TCG. Rich democracies provide the most favorable political setting for participation in TCG. National policies that favor climate change mitigation produce greater engagement with TCG on the part of nonstate and subnational actors. The same political ecology that produces favorable national policies supports TCG participation: NGO presence and activism, affluent consumers that encourage corporations to engage with TCG, subnational governments with political incentives and fiscal space to undertake cross-border activism. Although direct effects by TCG on greenhouse gas emissions may be limited, TCG may have longer-run and second-order effects that are larger, particularly if commitments are more precise and binding. Overall, TCG illustrates a complementary rather than competitive relationship between national governments and complex governance, a relationship that should be investigated in other issue areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	12	0305-0629	1547-7444		WOS:000394503500007		J	Farnworth, Cathy Rozel; Stirling, Clare; Sapkota, Tek B.; Jat, M.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY				15	2			136	152		10.1080/14735903.2017.1295343				2017	2017	For agriculture to play a role in climate change mitigation strategies to reduce emissions from inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer through a more balanced and efficient use are necessary. Such strategies should align with the overarching principle of sustainable intensification and will need to consider the economic, environmental and social trade-offs of reduced fertilizer-related emissions. However, the gender equity dimensions of such strategies are rarely considered. The case studies cited in this paper, from India, Lake Victoria in East Africa and more broadly from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), show that the negative externalities of imbalanced inorganic N use in high-and low-use scenarios impact more strongly on women and children. We examine, through a literature review of recent work in SSA, the relative jointness of intra-household bargaining processes in low N use scenarios to assess the degree to which they impact upon N use. We suggest that genderequitable strategies for achieving more balanced use of N will increase the likelihood of attaining macro-level reductions in GHG emissions provided that they secure equity in intra-household decision-making and address food security. Gender-equitable N use efficiency strategies will help to integrate and assure gender and social equity co-benefits at local scales.									6	0	0	3	0	6	3	16	1473-5903	1747-762X		WOS:000396821300004		S	Usman, Adil			IEEE					Sustainable Development Through Climate Change Mitigation and Biomass Agriculture: India's Perspective								2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY (SUSTECH 2017)		IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability SusTech						20	26						2017	2017	The design and contribution to Sustainable Development (SD) is not necessarily about new innovative technologies, but about retrospection how to meet the need for optimum economic growth while at the same time reducing the adverse climatic and environmental impacts.

Questioning demand: A study of regretted purchases in Great Britain								ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS				131				499	509		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.06.028				JAN 2017	2017	This paper presents findings from a nationally representative household survey on the tendency to regret purchases across 20 product groups. The survey reveals that the vast majority of adults in Great Britain (82%) have regretted a purchase in the past. Post-purchase regret is shown to be particularly prevalent for clothing & footwear and takeaway food. The tendency to regret purchases appears to reduce with age and to be more common amongst white collar rather than blue collar workers. Combining survey results with average price estimates gives an estimated, aggregate, annual expenditure on regretted purchases of 5-25bn, equivalent to 2-10% of annual consumer spending on goods in Great Britain. These findings are interesting because they suggest that there is a degree of self-assessed over-consumption that, if reduced, could help to reduce pressures on the environment. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Several studies have pointed to the generally positive nature of the relationship between the economic and environmental performance of tourism firms. Yet, although business models act as a vector between these aspects of firm performance, they have been overlooked in sustainable tourism discourse. The paper reports findings from discussion groups of SMTE businesses in South West England during the global economic downturn. Environmental costs and cost control were afforded relatively little importance in terms of value creation; conversely, there was a strong and predictable emphasis on revenue generation. Indirect tactics emerged for dealing with guests' environmental behaviours which reflected this prevailing commercial logic. Green credentials were routinely de-emphasized, sometimes regarded as liabilities, in a form of greenhushing. Responses were framed by reference to social media and how online reviews may negatively impact on future value capture. Conceptually, the business model emerged as an important lens for understanding how environmental resources and costs were valourized. The paper highlights the need to ensure that contemporary approaches to environmental management in SMTEs reflect the current and fastchanging conditions that frame business models.									8	0	0	1	0	8	3	19	0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000399560100002		B	Ji, Youngmin; Choi, Woo Suk; Ok, Kisu; Ahn, Jooyoung; Yoo, Junjae			ACM					Space Inference System for Buildings using IoT								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION PROCESSING (ICCIP 2017)								140	145		10.1145/3162957.3163023				2017	2017	Korea has continued to receive international pressure on GHG (Greenhouse Gas) reduction as it is the world's seventh-largest GHG emission source, and the government has already submitted to the UN INDCs (Intended National Determined Contributions) to reduce 37% of its GHG emission compared to a Business As Usual (BAU) in post-2020 on June 2015. There are various methods to save energy in order to fulfill this reduction obligation. The most effective methods are to increase the energy efficiency of the building, which accounts for about 30% of the existing energy consumption in Korea. Most of the existing buildings do not use 30% of the building space. To reduce this, a system such as BEMS (Building Energy Management System) is needed to grasp and monitor the environment inside the low-cost buildings. However, most BEMS systems are very expensive, and small-scale buildings are difficult to apply because of the low cost of investment. In this paper, we propose a system for inferring the energy use status of each space by collecting environmental information of existing buildings using IoT device. The IoT sensor uses the temperature, humidity, CO2 (Carbon Dioxide), and PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to judge whether the thermal comfort of the room and the room is occupied or not, and whether the energy is efficiently consumed by the space. Finally, the intelligent system can utilize the historical data of the inferred occupant to predict the occupancy in advance for the control.					3rd International Conference on Communication and Information Processing (ICCIP)3rd International Conference on Communication and Information Processing (ICCIP)	NOV 24-26, 2017NOV 24-26, 2017		Tokyo, JAPANTokyo, JAPAN	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0			978-1-4503-5365-6	WOS:000455705800027		J	Wang, Shoubing; Xu, Ziran; Zhang, Weiqian; Fan, Zhengqiu; Feng, Shuqing; Liu, Yan								Effects of aggregate reuse for overpass reconstruction-extension projects on energy conservation and greenhouse gas reduction: A case study from Shanghai City								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				140				1444	1453		10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.10.007				JAN 1 2017	2017	Currently urban overpasses (new-construction, reconstruction and extension) are being constructed on a large scale in China. While the construction projects are beneficial to the economic and social development, they have also caused serious ecological and environmental problems. On one hand, the final disposal of construction wastes requires a large amount of land, and the extraction of virgin aggregate destroys the local ecological environment. On the other hand, the energy consumption and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the entire life cycle are massive. To reduce the ecological and environmental impacts and to improve the resource use efficiency during the overpass construction, it is necessary to change the traditional linear resource use mode (aggregate-buildings-garbage) into a circular mode (aggregate-buildings- reused/regenerated aggregate-buildings). Using the life cycle inventory (LCI) method, the energy consumption and the GHG emissions are investigated for two different kinds of reconstruction and extension projects for overpasses in Shanghai City, using virgin and regenerated aggregates, respectively. Through that, the actual energy conservation and the GHG reduction benefits from using the regenerated aggregate are determined. Important first-hand data on the extraction of aggregate, the regeneration of aggregate, and the demolition of the discarded overpass, in a real situation, are gathered. The results show that, for the life cycle of aggregate, the energy consumption and the GHG emissions from reused aggregate can be reduced to 45.27% and 43.91%, respectively, compared to the virgin aggregate. For the life cycle of road concrete, the figures mentioned above would be 3.48% and 1.33%, respectively. In order to reduce the total energy consumption and GHG emissions from the reconstruction and extension projects of the overpasses, it is essential to find a way to reduce the amount of cement used, as well as the energy consumed and the GHG emitted during the cement production.

In the formulation of climate policy, the issues of trade in cleantech goods, and the promotion of cleantech industries through industrial policy measures such as local content requirements, now loom large. The case for reconciliation between the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and World Trade Organization (WTO) is now becoming stronger, and calls for specific steps to enable trade to accommodate green industry promotion strategies. Specifically, it is proposed that the next Conference of the Parties under the UNFCCC, to be staged in Morocco late in 2016, adopt a resolution calling on the WTO to recognize the authority of the UNFCCC in recognizing climate change mitigation as a 'public good', whose pursuit might allow for temporary use of industrial development policies such as local content requirements, if countries wished to follow such a strategy.Policy relevanceCountries' trade policies are currently formulated without reference to climate change, while climate change strategies are formulated without reference to principles of fair trade. The article proposes means through which the two regimes, governing trade and climate change, and the two principal bodies involved, the WTO and UNFCCC, can be brought to a state of mutual recognition and (prospective) harmony. The implications for climate policy are traced.					21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)	20152015		Paris, FRANCEParis, FRANCE	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	32	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000387996200009		J	Okoroh, J.

A structured interview schedule was used to collect data from 220 farmers. Frequency, percentages and mean statistic were used to present the results of the data collected. The results show that the mean age of the farmers was 51 years with an average of 22 years of farming experience. The majority (75%) of the farmers were aware of climate change within their environment. Self-observation and experience (42.4%) over the years was the source of awareness of climate change. The majority (73.6%) of the farmers opined that in recent times, flooding had increased which is an indication of climate change. Reduction in the use of generator to get power in the farmers' houses (69.1%) and crop rotation practices (67.3%) were mitigation and adaptation strategies employed by the farmers against the effect of climate change. The study recommends that government of states should enforce the policy on afforestation as a mitigation measure against climate change.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	6	1119-944X	2408-6851		WOS:000398456800010		J	Cheng, Ming-Hsun; Yang, Minliang; Wang, Yu				Yang, Minliang/V-6838-2019	Cheng, Ming-Hsun/0000-0002-3428-7535			American's Energy Future: An Analysis of the Proposed Energy Policy Plans in Presidential Election								ENERGIES				9	12					1000	10.3390/en9121000				DEC 2016	2016	As the leader of the largest economy, President of the United States has substantive influence on addressing climate change problems. However, a presidential election is often dominated by issues other than energy problems. This paper focuses on the 2016 presidential election, and examines the energy plans proposed by the leading Democrat and Republican candidates. Our data from the Iowa caucus survey in January 2016 suggests that voters were more concerned about terrorism and economic issues than environmental issues. We then compare the Democratic and Republican candidate's view of America's energy future, and evaluate their proposed renewable energy targets. We find that the view on renewable energy is polarized between Democratic and Republican candidates, while candidates from both parties agree on the need for energy efficiency. Results from our ordinal least squares regression models suggests that Democratic candidates have moderate to ambitious goals for developing solar and other renewables. The Republican candidates favor fossil fuels and they choose not to provide any specific target for developing renewable energy. In addition, this trend of party polarization has grown more significant when compared with the past three presidential elections. Our observation suggests that energy policies need to be discussed more often regarding the diversification and decarbonization of the nation's energy system.									28	1	0	1	0	29	0	11	1996-1073			WOS:000392402700001		J	Loo, Becky P.

This paper extends the theoretical debate and methodology on decoupling in transport to cover environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) issues as well as the economic dimensions (e.g. income growth and transport activities). The typology developed here details the concepts of absolute and relative decoupling in a strong and weak version. This typology is then applied to explore the potential and the reality of transport decoupling in 15 major countries over the period since 1990, when concerns over the global environment and social issues have become a central part of the sustainable development agenda, through the measurement of changes in all three of the elements of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social). Two key transport externalities, carbon dioxide emissions and traffic fatalities, are studied, as these represent examples of environmental and social costs associated with increased levels of mobility. These 15 key countries included both developed and developing countries, and they together account for the majority of the global economy, carbon emissions and a substantial proportion of transport fatalities. The results show that decarbonisation of the transport sector has proved more difficult to achieve in the 15 countries over the 22 years than the reduction in the levels of transport-related fatalities. Nevertheless, there is progress beiug made. Decoupling has taken place in both developed and developing countries, though the experiences vary in terms of timing (earlier vs more recent), consistency (stable vs variable), form (absolute vs relative) and magnitude (strong vs weak). Recoupling effects are limited. Transport has proved to be the most difficult sector to make more sustainable, as it is growing so fast and as it is necessary to support economies and lifestyles. Yet through combining measures of economic (e.g. income), environmental (e.g. carbon) and social (e.g. fatalities) wellbeing, it has been possible to identify positive trends in decoupling transport at the national level, as measured through relative decoupling. The much harder objective of an absolute decoupling is only just beginning to take place, but this must be seen as the primary objective in moving towards sustainability in the transport sector.

Until recently, most climate change mitigation incentive programs for avoided conversion have focused on forested ecosystems. We applied the Avoided Conversion of Grasslands and Shrublands v.1.0 (ACoGS) methodology now available through the American Carbon Registry to a threatened region of grasslands in the northern Great Plains. For all soil types across 14 counties in North and South Dakota, we used the DAYCENT model calibrated to the study area to quantify the difference in CO2 and N2O emissions under a cropping and a protection scenario, and we used formulas in the ACoGS methodology to calculate CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation under the protection scenario. We mapped the resulting GHG emissions across the entire project area. Emissions averaged 51.6 tCO(2)e/ha over 20 years, and with a 31% reduction for leakage and uncertainty from the ACoGS methodology, carbon offsets averaged 35.6 tCO(2)e/ha over 20 years. Protection of 10% of the 2.1 million unprotected ha in the project area with the highest emissions would reduce emissions by 11.7 million tCO(2)e over 20 years (11% of the total emissions from all unprotected grassland) and avoid a social cost of $430 million worth of CO2 emissions. These results suggest that carbon offsets generated from avoided conversion of grasslands can meaningfully contribute to climate mitigation and grassland conservation objectives.									6	0	0	2	0	6	3	28	2150-8925			WOS:000390136700004		J	Wang, Li; Zhong, Buqing; Vardoulakis, Sotiris; Zhang, Fengying; Pilot, Eva; Li, Yonghua; Yang, Linsheng; Wang, Wuyi; Krafft, Thomas				Yang, Linsheng/H-4326-2011	Yang, Linsheng/0000-0001-9603-6507; Pilot, Eva/0000-0003-3112-4447; Vardoulakis, Sotiris/0000-0003-3944-7128; Krafft, Thomas/0000-0002-6164-7815			Air Quality Strategies on Public Health and Health Equity in Europe-A Systematic Review								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				13	12					1196	10.3390/ijerph13121196				DEC 2016	2016	Air pollution is an important public health problem in Europe and there is evidence that it exacerbates health inequities. This calls for effective strategies and targeted interventions. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies relating to air pollution control on public health and health equity in Europe. Three databases, Web of Science, PubMed, and Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI), were searched for scientific publications investigating the effectiveness of strategies on outdoor air pollution control, public health and health equity in Europe from 1995 to 2015. A total of 15 scientific papers were included in the review after screening 1626 articles. Four groups of strategy types, namely, general regulations on air quality control, road traffic related emission control interventions, energy generation related emission control interventions and greenhouse gas emission control interventions for climate change mitigation were identified. All of the strategies reviewed reported some improvement in air quality and subsequently in public health. The reduction of the air pollutant concentrations and the reported subsequent health benefits were more significant within the geographic areas affected by traffic related interventions. Among the various traffic related interventions, low emission zones appeared to be more effective in reducing ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter levels. Only few studies considered implications for health equity, three out of 15, and no consistent results were found indicating that these strategies could reduce health inequity associated with air pollution. Particulate matter (particularly fine particulate matter) and NO2 were the dominant outdoor air pollutants examined in the studies in Europe in recent years. Health benefits were gained either as a direct, intended objective or as a co-benefit from all of the strategies examined, but no consistent impact on health equity from the strategies was found. The strategy types aiming to control air pollution in Europe and the health impact assessment methodology were also discussed in this review.									8	0	0	2	0	8	0	39	1660-4601			WOS:000389571900024		J	Franzen, Axel; Mader, Sebastian								Predictors of national CO2 emissions: do international commitments matter?								CLIMATIC CHANGE				139	3-4			491	502		10.1007/s10584-016-1795-x				DEC 2016	2016	Carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of anthropogenic climate change and play a central role in discussions on climate change mitigation. Previous research has demonstrated that national carbon dioxide emissions are driven mainly by population size and wealth. However, the variation in per capita emissions of nations with similar standards of living and similar population is huge. In this paper we investigate the drivers of national per capita carbon dioxide emissions over and above already known factors. In particular, we extend previous research by taking into account countries' shares of imports and exports, indicators of political interventions such as energy prices, and the use of renewable energy sources. Moreover, we also examine whether international commitments, such as the ones made by many nations at climate summits of the United Nations, matter. We use country-level data from 1980 to 2014 and estimate fixed effects panel regression models. In accordance with former research we find no environmental Kuznets curve with respect to carbon dioxide per capita emission levels. However, higher energy prices and the availability of alternative energy sources both reduce emissions. Furthermore, voluntary international environmental commitments also motivate countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	15	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000388962300011		J	Barreiro, Susana; Schelhaas, Mart-Jan; Kaendler, Gerald; Anton-Fernandez, Clara; Colin, Antoine; Bontemps, Jean-Daniel; Alberdi, Iciar; Condes, Sonia; Dumitru, Marius; Ferezliev, Angel; Fischer, Christoph; Gasparini, Patrizia; Gschwantner, Thomas; Kindermann, Georg; Kjartansson, Bjarki; Kovacsevics, Pal; Kucera, Milos; Lundstrom, Anders; Marin, Gheorghe; Mozgeris, Gintautas; Nord-Larsen, Thomas; Packalen, Tuula; Redmond, John; Sacchelli, Sandro; Sims, Allan; Snorrason, Arnor; Stoyanov, Nickola; Thurig, Esther; Wikberg, Per-Erik				Thurig, Esther/E-1235-2017; Anton-Fernandez, Clara/C-2427-2009; Mozgeris, Gintautas/W-2850-2019; Sims, Allan/A-5119-2009; Barreiro, Susana/I-5673-2012; Nord-Larsen, Thomas/C-9851-2015; Anton-Fernandez, Clara/P-2409-2019	Anton-Fernandez, Clara/0000-0001-5545-3320; Mozgeris, Gintautas/0000-0002-8480-6006; Sims, Allan/0000-0003-1312-6940; Barreiro, Susana/0000-0003-0174-854X; Nord-Larsen, Thomas/0000-0002-5341-6435; Anton-Fernandez, Clara/0000-0001-5545-3320; Condes, Sonia/0000-0002-4438-8305; Kindermann, Georg Erich/0000-0003-4297-1318; Schelhaas, Mart-Jan/0000-0003-4525-2677			Overview of methods and tools for evaluating future woody biomass availability in European countries								ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE				73	4			823	837		10.1007/s13595-016-0564-3				DEC 2016	2016	This analysis of the tools and methods currently in use for reporting woody biomass availability in 21 European countries has shown that most countries use, or are developing, National Forest Inventory-oriented models whereas the others use standwise forest inventory--oriented methods.Knowledge of realistic and sustainable wood availability in Europe is highly relevant to define climate change mitigation strategies at national and European level, to support the development of realistic targets for increased use of renewable energy sources and of industry wood. Future scenarios at European level highlight a deficit of domestic wood supply compared to wood consumption, and some European countries state they are harvesting above the increment.Several country-level studies on wood availability have been performed for international reporting. However, it remains essential to improve the knowledge on the projection methods used across Europe to better evaluate forecasts.Analysis was based on descriptions supplied by the national correspondentsinvolved in USEWOOD COST Action (FP1001), and further enriched with additionaldata from international reports that allowedcharacterisation of the forests in these countries for the same base year.Methods currently used for projecting wood availability were described for 21 European countries. Projection systems based on National Forest Inventory (NFI) data prevail over methods based on forest management plans. Only a few countries lack nationwide projection tools, still using tools developed for specific areas.A wide range of NFI-based systems for projecting wood availability exists, being under permanent improvement. The validation of projection forecasts and the inclusion of climate sensitive growth models into these tools are common aims for most countries. Cooperation among countries would result in higher efficiency when developing and improving projection tools and better comparability among them.									22	1	0	10	0	23	1	20	1286-4560	1297-966X		WOS:000390004000004		J	Sun, Xiaoyang; Zhang, Baosheng; Tang, Xu; McLellan, Benjamin C.; Hook, Mikael				McLellan, Benjamin C/B-7833-2009; Hook, Mikael/I-3479-2019	McLellan, Benjamin C/0000-0002-4802-3864; Hook, Mikael/0000-0002-6379-7104; Tang, Xu/0000-0003-3068-1524			Sustainable Energy Transitions in China: Renewable Options and Impacts on the Electricity System								ENERGIES				9	12					980	10.3390/en9120980				DEC 2016	2016	Chinese energy consumption has been dominated by coal for decades, but this needs to change to protect the environment and mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Renewable energy development is needed to fulfil the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) for the post-2020 period, as stated on the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. This paper reviews the potential of renewable energy in China and how it could be utilised to meet the INDC goals. A business-as-usual case and eight alternative scenarios with 40% renewable electricity are explored using the EnergyPLAN model to visualise out to the year 2030. Five criteria (total cost, total capacity, excess electricity, CO2 emissions, and direct job creation) are used to assess the sustainability of the scenarios. The results indicate that renewables can meet the goal of a 20% share of non-fossil energy in primary energy and 40%-50% share of non-fossil energy in electricity power. The low nuclear-hydro power scenario is the most optimal scenario based on the used evaluation criteria. The Chinese government should implement new policies aimed at promoting integrated development of wind power and solar PV.									23	1	0	0	0	23	2	71	1996-1073			WOS:000388604700002		J	Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Doll, Christopher N.

This paper examines empirically the links between climate change mitigation and health in urban areas, when health is the main driver for improvements. The paper aims to understand how systems of urban governance can enable or prevent the creation of health outcomes via continuous improvements in the environmental conditions in a city. The research draws on cases from two Indian cities where initiatives were undertaken in different sectors: Surat (waste) and Delhi (transportation). Using the literature on network effectiveness as an analytical framework, the paper compares the cases to identify the possible ways to strengthen the governance and policy making process in the urban system so that each intervention can intentionally realize multiple impacts for both local health and climate change mitigation in the long term as well as factors that may pose a threat to long- term progress and revert back to the previous situation after initial achievements.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION				43	4			407	416		10.1017/S0376892916000229				DEC 2016	2016	Deforestation and forest degradation in the Peruvian Amazon represent a major threat to biodiversity-related ecosystem services and the global climate. In 2010, the Peruvian Ministry of Environment launched the National Forest Conservation Program for Climate Change Mitigation, an innovative approach to maintaining forest cover of over 54 million hectares of land in protected areas and indigenous and peasant communities. A key component is a payments for environmental services scheme encouraging investments in sustainable land and forest uses in community-controlled territories. We conducted an ex-ante assessment of how the program would play out in terms of conservation cost-effectiveness, income effects and distributional (equity) outcomes if payments were up-scaled, as intended, to all native communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Our spatially explicit impact assessment relied on remotely sensed deforestation data and field data-supported estimates of conservation opportunity costs. We found that the spatially heterogeneous distribution of forestland and economic returns to multiple land uses across communities results in important tradeoffs between hypothetical cost-effectiveness, poverty alleviation and equity outcomes. Nevertheless, our scenario analyses suggested that alternative design options for payment schemes could improve both cost-effectiveness and equity outcomes simultaneously.									7	0	0	1	0	7	1	31	0376-8929	1469-4387		WOS:000387551700012		J	Seghetta, Michele; Hou, Xiaoru; Bastianoni, Simone; Bjerre, Anne-Belinda; Thomsen, Marianne					Seghetta, Michele/0000-0003-3316-790X; Thomsen, Marianne/0000-0003-2453-5141			Life cycle assessment of macroalgal biorefinery for the production of ethanol, proteins and fertilizers - A step towards a regenerative bioeconomy								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				137				1158	1169		10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.195				NOV 20 2016	2016	Seaweed is a key biomass for the development of a biobased economy because it contains valuable components such as proteins, sugars, nitrogen and phosphorus. This paper analyses innovative offshore seaweed cultivation for the production of biorefinery feedstock.. The biomass is converted into three products: bioethanol, liquid fertilizer and protein-rich ingredient for fish feed. We performed comparative life cycle assessment of a base case and six alternative production scenarios in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the trade-offs in environmental performance of future macroalgal biorefineries (MABs). The results show that the base case provides a net reduction in climate change factors, i.e. -0.1.10(2) kg CO2 eq. per ha of sea cultivated despite a cumulativ"e net energy demand of 3.9.10(4) MJ/ha, 13% of which originates from fossil sources. Regarding the environmental performance of the system, we obtained a reduction in marine eutrophication of -16.3 kg N eq./ha, thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen. For the base case the net impact on human toxicity (carcinogenic effects) was 2.1.10(-4) comparative toxic units per ha of cultivation. The increase in human toxicity is seven times greater than the system can deal with, however reduction of materials for the cultivation lines, i.e. iron ballast, reduces human toxicity to 0.2.10(-5) comparative toxic units. Externalities from the use of biofertilizer affect the non-carcinogenic effects of the system, resulting in 20.3.10(-4) comparative toxic units per ha. Hotspots in the value chain show that biomass productivity is the main constraint against being competitive with other energy and protein producing technologies. Minor changes in plant design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer). Including engineered ecosystem services in the LCA significantly improves the results. As such, an increase in soil carbon stock represents 15% of the climate change mitigation provided by the MAB system. The study shows that MABs can contribute to a regenerative circular economy through environmental restoration and climate mitigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Changes in population, dietary preferences, technology and crop productivity have all played important roles in shaping today's land use. In this paper, we explore how past and present developments in diets impact on global agricultural land use. We introduce an index for the Human Appropriation of Land for Food (HALF), and use it to isolate the effects of diets on agricultural land areas, including the potential consequences of shifts in consumer food preferences. We find that if the global population adopted consumption patterns equivalent to particular current national per capita rates, agricultural land use area requirements could vary over a 14-fold range. Within these variations, the types of food commodities consumed are more important than the quantity of per-capita consumption in determining the agricultural land requirement, largely due to the impact of animal products and in particular ruminant species. Exploration of the average diets in the USA and India (which lie towards but not at global consumption extremes) provides a framework for understanding land use impacts arising from different food corisumption habits. Hypothetically, if the world were to adopt the average Indian diet, 55% less agricultural land would be needed to satisfy demand, while global consumption of the average USA diet would necessitate 178% more land. Waste and over-eating are also shown to be important. The area associated with food waste, including over-consumption, given global adoption of the consumption patterns of the average person in the USA, was found to be twice that required for all food production given an average Indian per capita consumption. Therefore, measures to influence future diets and reduce food waste could substantially contribute towards global food security, as well as providing climate change mitigation options.

The selection of green technologies can be a challenging task, where multiple criteria exist and interrelate. However, it is still common for decisions to be based on a single criterion, such as energy efficiency or cost. This paper aims to evaluate the application of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to the selection of green technologies for retrofitting to existing buildings. The paper begins with a review of MCDM methods and the use of these techniques for selecting technologies to retrofit existing buildings. The applicability of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a widely used MCDM method, is demonstrated through a case study of a building that is part of a university estate. The findings show that AHP can help to formulate the problem, and facilitate the assessment and ranking of retrofitting measures when multiple criteria are jointly considered. We have shown that by considering environmental and economic criteria, control technologies such as variable speed drives in air handling units, rank most highly in this case. It has also been suggested that social criteria, such as occupant satisfaction, should also be considered as part of the sustainability agenda, although this can be more difficult to achieve than consideration of environmental and economic criteria, which are more readily characterised using quantitative data. We conclude by proposing an integrated green technology assessment and selection framework, which is applicable to existing buildings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.									10	0	0	7	0	10	2	47	0006-3606	1744-7429		WOS:000388307100016		J	Bakaki, Zorzeta; Bernauer, Thomas								Measuring and explaining the willingness to pay for forest conservation: evidence from a survey experiment in Brazil								ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS				11	11					114001	10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/114001				NOV 2016	2016	Recent research suggests that there is substantial public support (including willingness to pay) for forest conservation. Based on a nationwide survey experiment in Brazil (N = 2500) the largest and richest of the world's tropical developing countries, we shed new light on this issue. To what extent does the public in fact support forest conservation and what factors are influencing support levels? Unlike previous studies, our results show that the willingness to pay for tropical forest conservation in Brazil is rather low. Moreover, framing forest conservation in terms of biodiversity protection, which tends to create more local benefits, does not induce more support than framing conservation in terms of mitigating global climate change. The results also show that low levels of trust in public institutions have a strong negative impact on the public's willingness to pay for forest conservation, individually and/or via government spending. What could other (richer) countries do, in this context, to encourage forest conservation in Brazil and other tropical developing countries? One key issue is whether prospects of foreign funding for forest conservation are likely to crowd out or, conversely, enhance the motivation for domestic level conservation efforts. We find that prospects of foreign funding have no significant effect on willingness to pay for forest conservation. These findings have at least three policy implications, namely, that the Brazilian public's willingness to pay for forest conservation is very limited, that large-scale international funding is probably needed, and that such funding is unlikely to encourage more domestic effort, but is also unlikely to crowd out domestic efforts. Restoring public trust in the Brazilian government is key to increasing public support for forest conservation in Brazil.									6	0	0	3	0	6	0	19	1748-9326			WOS:000387037200001		J	Palmquist, Kyle A.; Schlaepfer, Daniel R.; Bradford, John B.; Lauenroth, William K.

To quantify climate change impacts on spatial patterns of ecohydrology across shrub steppe ecosystems in North America, we asked the following question: How will climate change impacts on ecohydrology differ in magnitude and variability across climatic gradients, among three big sagebrush ecosystems (SB-Shrubland, SB-Steppe, SB-Montane), and among Sage-grouse Management Zones? We explored these potential changes for mid-century for RCP8.5 using a process-based water balance model (SOILWAT) for 898 big sagebrush sites using site-and scenario-specific inputs. We summarize changes in available soil water (ASW) and dry days, as these ecohydrological variables may be helpful in guiding land management decisions about where to geographically concentrate climate change mitigation and adaptation resources. Our results suggest that during spring, soils will be wetter in the future across the western United States, while soils will be drier in the summer. The magnitude of those predictions differed depending on geographic position and the ecosystem in question: Larger increases in mean daily spring ASW were expected for high-elevation SB-Montane sites and the eastern and central portions of our study area. The largest decreases in mean daily summer ASW were projected for warm, dry, mid-elevation SB-Montane sites in the central and west-central portions of our study area (decreases of up to 50%). Consistent with declining summer ASW, the number of dry days was projected to increase rangewide, but particularly for SB-Montane and SB-Steppe sites in the eastern and northern regions. Collectively, these results suggest that most sites will be drier in the future during the summer, but changes were especially large for mid-to high-elevation sites in the northern half of our study area. Drier summer conditions in high-elevation, SB-Montane sites may result in increased habitat suitability for big sagebrush, while those same changes will likely reduce habitat suitability for drier ecosystems. Our work has important implications for where land managers should prioritize resources for the conservation of North American shrub steppe plant communities and the species that depend on them.									15	0	0	10	0	15	1	21	2150-8925			WOS:000392207600023		J	Olson-Hazboun, Shawn K.; Krannich, Richard S.; Robertson, Peter G.

However, some researchers studying social responses to renewables have found that factors other than opinions about climate change may be more influential in determining support for renewables. This study analyzes survey data from a study of five communities in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S. experiencing wind energy development to examine the relationship between environmental beliefs, climate change opinions, and support for renewable energy. Results show that views on renewable energy comprise a distinct dimension of public views on energy, environment, and climate, suggesting that public support for renewable energy is less related to environmental beliefs than to some other factors, including beliefs about economic benefits and concerns about landscape impacts. Findings also indicate that the frequency with which individuals see nearby wind turbines are strongly related to their level of support for renewable energy, while physical proximity is not. Overall, results suggest that ceasing to frame renewable energy as an environmental issue and instead framing it in a way that invokes locally relevant social values may garner broader public support.

The perspectives of key UK energy system stakeholders have been to develop three socio-technical narratives of energy system change that are quantified in a 24-techno-economic model of the country. Implementing these three narratives in the model allows their feasibility for meeting climate targets to be assessed as well as articulating implied sub-national regional outlooks for technologies and investment. The latter elements are in light of the regional socioeconomic and demographic landscape. The study highlights some the regional political dimensions associated with future investment targeting in the UK energy system. particular, energy policy decisions may create tensions between the four different UK government as well as raising important questions about regional economic development and how equitable energy transition can be achieved for all.

Spatial-based statistical modelling provides an efficient approach for the analysis and prediction of air temperatures in human-modified environments at high spatial accuracy. The aim of the study was firstly, to analyse the environmental factors affecting extreme air temperature conditions in a coastal high-latitude city and secondly, to explore the applicability of generalized additive model (GAM) in the study of urban-rural temperatures. We utilized air temperature data from 50 permanent temperature logger stations and extensive geospatial environmental data on different scales from Turku, SW Finland. We selected five temperature situations (cases) and altogether 12 urban and natural explanatory variables for the analyses. The results displayed that (i) water bodies and topographical conditions were often more important than urban variables in controlling the spatial variability of extreme air temperatures, (ii) case specificity of the explanatory variables and their scales should be considered in the analyses and (iii) GAM was highly suitable in quantifying and visualizing the relations between urban-rural temperatures and environmental determinants at local scales. The results promote the use of GAMs in spatial-based statistical modelling of air temperature in future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The UK industrial sector is complex, because it may be viewed as consisting of some 350 separate combinations of subsectors, devices and technologies. Various energy analysis and carbon accounting techniques applicable to industry are described and assessed. The contributions of the energy-intensive (EI) and nonenergy-intensive (NEI) industrial subsectors over recent decades are evaluated with the aid of decomposition analysis. An observed drop in aggregate energy intensity over this timescale was driven by different effects: energy efficiency improvements; structural change; and fuel switching. Finally, detailed case studies drawn from the Cement subsector and that associated with Food and Drink are examined; representing the EI and NEI subsectors, respectively. Currently available technologies will lead to further, short-term energy and CO2 emissions savings in manufacturing, but the prospects for the commercial exploitation of innovative technologies by mid-21st century are far more speculative. There are a number of nontechnological barriers to the take-up of such technologies going forward. Consequently, the transition pathways to a low carbon future in UK industry by 2050 will exhibit large uncertainties. The attainment of significant falls in carbon emissions over this period depends critically on the adoption of a limited number of key technologies [e.g., carbon capture and storage (CCS), energy efficiency techniques, and bioenergy], alongside a decarbonization of the electricity supply.

Being flexible and allowing energy storage, it also facilitates the development of intermittent energy in electricity systems. The development, operation and maintenance of hydropower production are closely related to growing concerns on environment sustainability, climate change mitigation and meeting societal needs for energy. Reliable and efficient hydropower facilities can improve hydropower performance and the environmental acceptability of new projects when they are also planned to protect the environment in which they operate. This document presents a synthesis report of the international conference HydroES 2016 - Hydropower & Environmental Sustainability, organized by SHF and hosted by INP ENSE3, in Grenoble, on 16-17 March 2016. It shows that the scientific community and the hydropower industry are committed to assessing environment and social impacts of hydropower and are proactive towards a sustainable future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	5	0018-6368	1958-5551		WOS:000387985900012		J	Hopkins, Debbie; Stephenson, Janet					Hopkins, Debbie/0000-0002-7778-8989			The replication and reduction of automobility: Findings from Aotearoa New Zealand								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY				56				92	101		10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.09.005				OCT 2016	2016	In this paper, we examine the factors that contribute to the replication or reduction of automobility amongst young adults. Semi-structured interviews conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand, with 51 drivers and nondrivers, aged 18-35 years old, form the empirical material. The findings build upon previous research and extend understandings of how seven explanatory factors; perceptual, value and preference, social, built environment, economic, legal/policy and technological, work both to continue the current automobility paradigm, and to challenge it by adopting alternative mobilities. We use the Energy Cultures Framework as an analytical tool to explore the ways through which materialites, norms, practices, and external context can replicate or reduce participation in the hegemonic mobility paradigm. This approach offers useful insights into the interactions between what the research participants think, have and do, and how this is resulting in a reduction in automobility norms amongst some younger people. It also identifies and highlights potential opportunities to leverage upon current change trends to assist a systemic transition away from automobility towards a culture of multi-mobilities.

In the present study, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was used to test the ability of agricultural management practices (N application rate, corn cultivar, planting date, tillage and controlled drainage) to mitigate future climate change effects on N losses and corn yield in a subsurface drained field in Iowa, USA. Under a future downscaled climate scenario, the simulated non constant N2O emission factor (EF), yield-scaled global warming potential and N loss through drainage increased with increasing fertilization above an optimal N rate of 120 kg N ha(-1). This rate represents the optimal tradeoff point between environmental issues and economic returns. While yields of the cultivar IB1068 DEKALB declined with climate change, yields of cultivar, IB 0090 GL 482 in the future climate were greater than historical yields of IB 1068 DEKALB.

Research has largely focused on local innovations with little consideration of the contextual and systemic elements that influence sustainable development across health systems. A realistic framework specifically to guide decision-making by health care providers is still needed. To address this deficit, the literature is explored in relation to health services and climate change mitigation strategies, and the contextual factors that influence efforts to mitigate climate effects in health service delivery environments are highlighted. A conceptual framework is proposed that offers a model for the pursuit of sustainable development practice in health services. A set of propositions is advanced to provide a systems approach to assist decision-making by decoding the challenges faced in implementing sustainable health services. This has important implications for health care providers, funders and legislators since the financial, policy and regulatory environment of health care, along with its leadership and models of care generally conflict with carbon literacy and climate change mitigation strategies.									4	0	0	0	0	4	0	8	1355-8196	1758-1060		WOS:000385353800008	27095136	J	Theodoropoulos, Theodoros V.; Damousis, Ioannis G.; Amditis, Angelos J.

Moreover, it minimizes the need for recharging stops, thus increasing travel comfort. As electrification of transport ultimately targets CO2 emissions reduction, increased utilization of renewable energy sources is likely to provide the means for reaching the decarbonization objectives. Demand-side management (DSM) enables the increased penetration of intermittent power sources by providing techniques that ensure grid stability. While complete frameworks for DSM deployment in static charging have been designed, these approaches must be re-evaluated with focus on the operational requirements for dynamic EV charging. In this paper, a review of DSM methods targeting static charging is made and one particular case of DSM is simulated in a dynamic charging environment in order to reveal critical aspects towards deployment.									7	1	0	0	0	8	1	23	0278-0046	1557-9948		WOS:000384641900062		J	Southall, Geoffrey D.; Khare, Anshuman								The feasibility of distributed hydrogen production from renewable energy sources and the financial contribution from UK motorists on environmental grounds								SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY				26				134	149		10.1016/j.scs.2016.05.009				OCT 2016	2016	Decarbonisation of the transport sector in the UK would serve to meet climate change obligations through greenhouse gas reductions, reduced pollution levels and an improvement of energy security through a reduced dependency on imported crude oil and refined fuels. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have the potential to fulfil these aims, more so when the hydrogen used to power them is produced from renewable energy sources. The electrolytic production of hydrogen at the point of sale eliminates the need for hydrogen distribution costs and promotes sustainability but the business case is dependent upon the production of hydrogen at an acceptable cost to the public. This study calculates the hydrogen production cost using varying capacity hybrid wind/solar PV systems and associated hydrogen generation, storage and dispensing technologies in supplying a scenario population exposed to average UK weather conditions. It examines if the environmental benefits are evident through the UK car-owning public's willingness to pay for a cleaner transportation fuel. Whilst the respondents' concerns for the environment are strong, a high degree of sensitivity over fuel pricing remains. In spite of this, the projected demand for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles through to 2030 and the use of renewable energy tariffs shows that certain configurations of hydrogen production infrastructure are still financially viable. The possibility exists for the application of fuel taxation whilst still maintaining price parity with conventional hydrocarbon fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We ask whether well-designed policies can reduce global material and energy use, and carbon emissions, with only minimal impacts on improvements in living standards. We use a novel approach of combined economic and environmental modelling to assess the potential for decoupling for 13 world regions and globally. We apply a production (territorial) and consumption approach to discuss regional differences in natural resource use and carbon emissions across three stylized policy outlooks: a reference case with no significant changes to environment and climate policies; a 'high efficiency' outlook involving a global carbon price rising from $50 to $236 (constant price) per tonne of CO2 between 2010 and 2050 and improvements in resource efficiency (rising from 1.5% historically to between 3.5% and 4.5% in the scenarios); and a 'medium efficiency' outlook midway between the 'no change' and 'high' outlooks. We find that global energy use will continue to grow rapidly under all three scenarios from 17 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 2010 to between 30 and 36 billion toe. Carbon emissions would be considerably lower with a global carbon price, less than half the level of the reference case (29-37 billion tonnes of CO2 instead of 74 billion tonnes) and also material use would grow much more slowly under a carbon price and significant investment to increase resource efficiency (95 instead of 180 billion tonnes of materials). We find that OECD economies have significant potential to reduce their material throughput and carbon emissions with little impact on economic growth, and that developing economies such as China could expand their economies at much lower environmental cost. Globally, the effects of very strong abatement and resource efficiency policies on economic growth and employment until 2050 are negligible. Our study suggests that decarbonization and dematerialization are possible with well-designed policy settings and would not contradict efforts to raise human wellbeing and standards of living. The research demonstrates the usefulness of scenarios for unpacking environmental and economic outcomes of policy alternatives. The findings have important implications for future economic opportunities in a highly resource efficient and low carbon global economy to set human development and achieving the sustainable development goals on a more resilient path.

It is therefore essential to quantify their effect on building energy use and indoor environmental quality when integrated into buildings. The evaluation of their performance presents new challenges when compared to conventional "static" building envelope systems, as they require design and control aspects to be evaluated together, which are also mutually interrelated across thermal and visual physical domains.This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel simulation framework for the performance evaluation of responsive building envelope technologies and, particularly, of switchable glazing. This is achieved by integrating a building energy simulation tool and a lighting simulation one, in a control optimisation framework to simulate advanced control of adaptive building envelopes. The performance of a photovoltachromic glazing is evaluated according to building energy use, Useful Daylight Illuminance, glare risk and load profile matching indicators for a sun oriented office building in different temperate climates. The original architecture of photovoltachromic cell provides an automatic control of its transparency as a function of incoming solar irradiance. However, to fully explore the building integration potential of photovoltachromic technology, different control strategies are evaluated, from passive and simple rule based controls, to optimised rule based and predictive controls.The results show that the control strategy has a significant impact on the performance of the photovoltachromic switchable glazing, and of switchable glazing technologies in general. More specifically, simpler control strategies are generally unable to optimise contrasting requirements, while more advanced ones can increase energy saving potential without compromising visual comfort. In cooling dominated scenarios reactive control can be as effective as predictive for a switchable glazing, differently than heating dominated scenarios where predictive control strategies yield higher energy saving potential. Introducing glare as a control parameter can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of some control strategies, especially in heating dominated climates. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

When communicating about climate change, however, uncertainty can be used and understood as 'not knowing', that is, as ignorance. In this article we aim to understand how 'uncertainty' is used in a specific cultural and media context at two important periods in time. Using a corpus linguistic approach, we examine how 'uncertainty' was used in the context of UK press coverage of climate change in 2010 (following 'Climategate') and in 2014-15, after the latest IPCC report had been published. We find that after Climategate and the (failed) Copenhagen summit, 'uncertainty' was used to question the authority and credibility of climate science; after the latest IPCC report and in the run-up to the (more successful) Paris summit, discussions focused on uncertainties inherent in various climate change mitigation activities and associated with the economy, environment and politics more generally.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	19	0341-2059	1613-4087		WOS:000387205400005		J	Muratori, Matteo; Calvin, Katherine; Wise, Marshall; Kyle, Page; Edmonds, Jae					Muratori, Matteo/0000-0003-1688-6742; Kyle, Page/0000-0002-1257-8358			Global economic consequences of deploying bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)								ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS				11	9					095004	10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095004				SEP 2016	2016	Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is considered a potential source of net negative carbon emissions and, if deployed at sufficient scale, could help reduce carbon dioxide emissions and concentrations. However, the viability and economic consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment are not fully understood. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) integrated assessment model to explore the potential global and regional economic impacts of BECCS. As a negative-emissions technology, BECCS would entail a net subsidy in a policy environment in which carbon emissions are taxed. We show that by mid-century, in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 degrees C, carbon tax revenues have peaked and are rapidly approaching the point where climate mitigation is a net burden on general tax revenues. Assuming that the required policy instruments are available to support BECCS deployment, we consider its effects on global trade patterns of fossil fuels, biomass, and agricultural products. We find that in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 degrees C, the absence of CCS harms fossil-fuel exporting regions, while the presence of CCS, and BECCS in particular, allows greater continued use and export of fossil fuels. We also explore the relationship between carbon prices, food-crop prices and use of BECCS. We show that the carbon price and biomass and food crop prices are directly related. We also show that BECCS reduces the upward pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. All of this notwithstanding, many challenges, both technical and institutional, remain to be addressed before BECCS can be deployed at scale.									24	0	0	4	0	24	3	35	1748-9326			WOS:000384060600002		J	Cameron, Laura; Potvin, Catherine								Characterizing desired futures of Canadian communities								FUTURES				82				37	51		10.1016/j.futures.2016.05.003				SEP 2016	2016	In sustainability research and practice, one method widely used in exploration is visioning, in which desirable sustainable futures are articulated and explored in depth. Communities across Canada have used this method to develop collective desirable futures, in many cases to provide an end goal for local sustainable development. In this paper, we conduct a meta analysis of desired futures created by communities across Canada with the aim of identifying regional commonalities according to the three pillars of sustainability, social, environmental, and economic. Although sustainability demands a balance between its social, economic and environmental components, Canadians futures apparently place the greatest importance on social aspects with 338 desires against 222 and 230 respectively for economic and environmental sustainability. Community (105); Infrastructure, development, and transportation (126); and Natural environment (157) are the categories most frequently recorded within each of the three components of sustainability. The metaanalysis also noted significant differences amongst regions. The study was conducted in the context of an initiative known as the Sustainable Canada Dialogues that mobilized 60 + scholars from across the country around a consensus on science based, viable solutions for greenhouse gas reduction. Our results suggest that climate policy that simultaneously reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing some of the key aspects of social sustainability would be attractive to many Canadians.

Nevertheless, focusing on some key systemic characteristics of cities can give useful insights for policy to advance health and well-being outcomes. Moreover, if we take a coevolutionary systems view of cities, some conventional assumptions about the nature of urban development (e.g. the growth in private vehicle use with income) may not stand up. We illustrate this by examining the coevolution of urban transport and land use systems, and institutional change, giving examples of policy implications. At a high level, our concern derives from the need to better understand the dynamics of urban change, and its implications for health and well-being. At a practical level, we see opportunities to use stylised findings about urban systems to underpin policy experiments.While it is now not uncommon to view cities as systems, policy makers appear to have made little use so far of a systems approach to inform choice of policies with consequences for health and well-being. System insights can be applied to intelligently anticipate change - for example, as cities are subjected to increasing natural system reactions to climate change, they must find ways to mitigate and adapt to it. Secondly, systems insights around policy cobenefits are vital for better informing horizontal policy integration. Lastly, an implication of system complexity is that rather than seeking detailed, 'full' knowledge about urban issues and policies, cities would be well advised to engage in policy experimentation to address increasingly urgent health and climate change issues.

Using independent cost estimates and sequentially "relaxing" the constraints on resource selection, this paper compares the resource costs of the resulting portfolios of assets needed to meet the need for electricity. It supports the claim that the long run costs of the 100% renewable portfolios are less than business-as-usual portfolios, and finds that the "environmental merit order" of asset selection is quite close to the "economic merit order." Neither fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage nor nuclear power enters the least-cost, low-carbon portfolio. Rigorous least-cost constraints on decarbonization render the pollution constraint is superfluous. The paper evaluates the Paris Agreement on climate change in light of these findings. The Agreement is described as a progressive, mixed market economic model with a governance structure based on a polycentric, multi-stakeholder approach for management of a common pool resource. It also notes that the political economy of the Agreement is consistent with current academic analysis of policy responses to the challenges of climate change and management of a large, focal core resource system.

Hamburg, Oslo, Helsinki, and Madrid have recently announced their plans to become (partly) private car free cities. Other cities like Paris, Milan, Chengdu, Masdar, Dublin, Brussels, Copenhagen, Bogota, and Hyderabad have measures that aim at reducing motorized traffic including implementing car free days, investing in cycling infrastructure and pedestrianization, restricting parking spaces and considerable increases in public transport provision. Such plans and measures are particularly implemented with the declared aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions are also likely to benefit public health.Aims: We aimed to describe the plans for private car free cities and its likely effects on public health.Methods: We reviewed the grey and scientific literature on plans for private car free cities, restricted car use, related exposures and health.Results: An increasing number of cities are planning to become (partly) private car free. They mainly focus on the reduction of private car use in city centers. The likely effects of such policies are significant reductions in traffic related air pollution, noise, and temperature in city centers. For example, up to a 40% reduction in NO2 levels has been reported on car free days. These reductions are likely to lead to a reduction in premature mortality and morbidity. Furthermore the reduction in the number of cars, and therefore a reduction in the need for parking places and road space, provides opportunities to increase green space and green networks in cities, which in turn can lead to many beneficial health effects. All these measures are likely to lead to higher levels of active mobility and physical activity which may improve public health the most and also provide more opportunities for people to interact with each other in public space. Furthermore, such initiatives, if undertaken at a sufficiently large scale can result in positive distal effects and climate change mitigation through CO2 reductions. The potential negative effects which may arise due to motorized traffic detouring around car free zone into their destinations also need further evaluation and the areas in which car free zones are introduced need to be given sufficient attention so as not to become an additional way to exacerbate socioeconomic divides. The extent and magnitude of all the above effects is still unclear and needs further research, including full chain health impact assessment modeling to quantify the potential health benefits of such schemes, and exposure and epidemiological studies to measure any changes when such interventions take place.Conclusions: The introduction of private car free cities is likely to have direct and indirect health benefits, but the exact magnitude and potential conflicting effects are as yet unclear. This paper has overviewed the expected health impacts, which can be useful to underpin policies to reduce car use in cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the climate challenges ahead this seems unjustified. Small and medium-sized cities (SMCs) deserve scholarly attention as well. The main question is: What factors influence climate change policy and local climate actions in SMCs? In this article we present an analytical framework to analyze climate change policy and local climate actions of SMCs. The framework addresses different aspects: policy-input, -throughput, -output, -outcome, characteristics of the local environment, local action arenas, influence by higher government levels, and interaction with climate change issue networks. The framework is used to analyze and compare four case studies of SMCs in the Dutch region of Twente (two urban and two rural municipalities, and addresses both adaptation and mitigation). Results show that both localist', multi-level' and issue network membership factors influence local climate policy action. Governance modes discerned concern mostly governing by authority' and self-governing'. When reflecting on the role of SMCs in climate action the study revealed the importance of local capacity building schemes issued by provincial government, inter-municipal network collaboration, and the potential for local governments to mobilize and organize citizen action.									8	0	0	2	0	8	0	22	2071-1050			WOS:000385529400019		J	Duncan, Clare; Primavera, Jurgenne H.; Pettorelli, Nathalie; Thompson, Julian R.; Loma, Rona Joy A.; Koldewey, Heather J.

To mitigate losses, rehabilitation is high on the conservation agenda. However, the relative functionality and ES delivery of rehabilitated mangroves in different intertidal locations is rarely assessed. In a case study from Panay Island, Philippines, using field- and satellite-derived methods, we assess carbon stocks and coastal protection potential of rehabilitated low-intertidal seafront and mid- to upper-intertidal abandoned (leased) fishpond areas, against reference natural mangroves. Due to large sizes and appropriate site conditions, targeted abandoned fishpond reversion to former mangrove was found to be favourable for enhancing CCMA in the coastal zone. In a municipality-specific case study, 96.7% of abandoned fishponds with high potential for effective greenbelt rehabilitation had favourable tenure status for reversion.

Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably - on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20 % and 80 % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions.									3	0	0	1	0	3	3	32	0165-0009	1573-1480		WOS:000378741900011		J	Sharifi, Ayyoob; Yamagata, Yoshiki				Yamagata, Yoshiki/H-7224-2018; Sharifi, Ayyoob/M-7584-2013	Sharifi, Ayyoob/0000-0002-8983-8613			Principles and criteria for assessing urban energy resilience: A literature review								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				60				1654	1677		10.1016/j.rser.2016.03.028				JUL 2016	2016	Between 60% and 80% of global energy is consumed in urban areas and given the projected increase in world's urban population, this share is expected to further increase in the future. Continuity of energy supply in cities is affected by climate change and a growing array of other threats such as cyber attacks, terrorism, technical deficiencies, and market volatility. Determined efforts, acknowledging the interactions and interlinkages between energy and other sectors, are needed to avoid adverse consequences of disruption in energy supply. Resilience thinking is an approach to management of socio-ecological systems that aims to develop an integrated framework for bringing together the (often) fragmented, diverse research on disaster risk management. The literature on urban resilience is immense and still growing. This paper reviews literature related to energy resilience to develop a conceptual framework for assessing urban energy resilience, identify planning and design criteria that can be used for assessing urban energy resilience, and examine the relationship of these criteria with the underlying components of the conceptual framework. In the conceptual framework, it is proposed that in order to be resilient, urban energy system needs to be capable of "planning and preparing for", "absorbing", "recovering from", and "adapting" to any adverse events that may happen in the future. Integrating these four abilities into the system would enable it to continuously address "availability", "accessibility", "affordability", and "acceptability" as the four sustainability-related dimensions of energy. The paper explains different resilience principles associated with these abilities and sustainability dimensions. Also, different planning and design criteria were extracted from the literature and categorized into five themes: infrastructure; resources; land use, urban geometry and morphology; governance; and socio-demographic aspects and human behavior. Examination of the relationship of these criteria with the underlying components of the conceptual framework highlighted the complexity and multi-faceted nature of energy resilience. Exploration of the relevance of the identified criteria to climate change mitigation and adaptation revealed that most of the identified criteria can provide both mitigation and adaptation benefits.

Evidence from German municipalities								ENERGY POLICY				94				317	330		10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.049				JUL 2016	2016	Municipalities aiming at mitigating climate change by implementing new energy efficiency technologies face budgetary and capacity constraints. Outsourcing through energy service contracting could provide a solution. This paper reports results from a survey of 1298 municipalities concerning barriers to retrofitting public street lighting and the possible role of energy service contracting to overcome these barriers. Using a logistic regression analysis, the authors investigate determinants of opting for energy service contracts in the specific context of LED retrofits. Results point to an advantage of outsourcing in a financially and capacity-constrained environment, which corresponds with the main reasons for engaging in contracting: minimising investments and financial risks. However, municipalities often do not fully grasp the risks associated with retrofitting especially using a novel technology such as LED. In relation to that they underestimate the risk reduction potential of energy performance contracts (EPC). Previous experience with outsourcing increases the probability to engage in servitization although certain existing partnerships, particularly with utilities, prevent municipalities from considering energy performance contracts. Interestingly, engaging an energy consultant has a negative propensity to use energy service contracts, while pre-negotiated standardised contracts for energy performance contracts have a positive influence.

The aim of this study is to assess the effects on health and well-being of GHG emissions reduction policies in the city of Geneva. Three projects related to climate change mitigation were identified, in three topic areas : urban planning, heating and transport. These projects are : a complex urbanisation plan in a neighbourhood of the city of Geneva (urban planning and heating), a sustainable transportation plan for a district in Geneva (transport) and a strategy to encourage City's employees to use sustainable mobility for local business travel (transport). The main issues investigated were physical activity, air quality, noise and energy. The methodological approach consisted in applying the Health Impact Assessment process. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess potential health impacts. For the first project, results show that the energy scenario with the least CO2 emissions is the best for limiting health impacts (and maximising co-benefits). For the second project, results show that the scenario with the most space devolved to pedestrians is the most beneficial for health especially in terms of cardiovascular disease prevention. The analysis of the strategy of the City of Geneva for local business travel revealed that the strengthening of sustainable modes of transportation for this purpose in the city would be favourable in terms of the environment (reduction of CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions) and health. It appears from this case-study in Geneva that cities can play a key role in tackling climate change while bringing co-benefits for health.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1635-0421	1952-3998		WOS:000408739400007		J	Damerau, Kerstin; Patt, Anthony G.; van Vliet, Oscar P.

Mainly required for irrigation, but also processing and cooling purposes, water is one of the essential resources in both sectors. Rising global population numbers and economic development could likely cause an increase in natural resource demand over the coming decades, while at the same time climate change might lead to lower overall water availability. The result could be an increased competition for water resources mainly in water-stressed regions of the world in the future. In this study we explore a set of possible changes in consumption patterns in the agricultural and energy sector that could be primarily motivated by other goals than water conservation measures for example personal health and climate change mitigation targets, and estimate the indirect effect such trends would have on global water requirements until 2050. Looking at five world regions, we investigated three possible changes regarding future food preferences, and two possible changes in future resource preferences for electricity and transport fuels. We find that while an increase in food supply as a result of higher protein demand would lead to an increase in water demand as well, this trend could be counteracted by other potential dietary shifts such as a reduction in grains and sugars. In the energy sector we find that an increasing water demand can be limited through specific resource and technology choices, while a significant growth of first-generation biofuels would lead to a drastic rise in water demand, potentially exceeding the water requirements for food supply. Looking at the two sectors together, we conclude that an overall increase in water demand for both food and energy is not inevitable and that changes in food and energy preferences could indeed lead to an alleviation of water resource use despite rising population numbers.

The carbon credit producer (the smallholder farmer) and carbon credit buyer in the carbon market transaction typically operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Buyers operate at a global scale, responding to opportunities for financial speculation and both private and public climate action plans. Farmers operate within households, farms, and immediate agricultural landscapes, pursuing livelihood and food security needs. These different scales often result in mismatches of timing, payment, and knowledge in market transactions and can be partially rectified by project developers who serve to broker the relationship between the farmers and the buyers. We examined eight East African agricultural carbon market projects to determine how project developers function as bridging organizations and minimize the mismatches between these actors. Results show that projects better bridged the timing and payment gap between buyers and producers when project developers provided non-monetary benefits or direct monetary assistance to farmers. However, knowledge gaps remained a significant barrier for farmers wishing to participate in the market. We discuss how project developers brokered relationships in ways that reflected their interests and highlight the limitations, trade-offs, and challenges that must be overcome if win-win outcomes of poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation are to be realized.

These shifts have potential implications for exposure to natural disasters. To examine this relationship, we use census microdata in conjunction with information on natural disaster events. The populations exposed to extreme weather events are first calculated based on observed disasters and demographic change between 2005 and 2010. This is compared to a hypothetical scenario with no migration between 2005 and 2010. The results presented in this research note demonstrate that while migration has slightly decreased overall exposure within Mexico, this influence is highly localized in select areas, with internal migration increasing exposure in key urban destinations. This highlights the need to better understand the interacting roles of household-scale migratory decision making and economic/urban growth policy in climate change mitigation, and provides guidance on geographic regions to target for more detailed analysis.									3	0	0	1	0	3	0	38	0894-1920	1521-0723		WOS:000373789600011	29606795	J	Yang, Ming								Energy service company and financial market development: experiences of the Global Environment Facility								MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE				21	5			663	676		10.1007/s11027-014-9603-2				JUN 2016	2016	Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) and the energy market for ESCO financing have been developing since 1976 when oil prices increased dramatically. ESCOs' services cover projects in many energy areas, including energy extraction, power generation, energy conversion, transportation, power transmission, energy consumption, project financing, energy project audits, monitoring, and energy savings verification. In developing countries, there are many barriers in the energy market that are preventing ESCOs from developing. These barriers include lack of appropriate policy, financial mechanisms, and local capacities for ESCO development and management. Over the past 20 years, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) financed 39 ESCO projects in 25 countries and regions to remove these barriers. The results of these projects show that some countries, such as China, are very successful in ESCO development, but others are not. Different models of ESCOs in different financial markets in various countries are analyzed; and case studies are undertaken for China, India, Ukraine, and Brazil. This article concludes that, while developing financial markets for ESCOs, countries need to consider (1) initiating national government policy to stop energy subsidies and to reform energy pricing, (2) establishing a real, market based financial mechanism for ESCOs, (3) involving the private sector in project co-financing, (4) creating incentives to ESCOs in the market by investing part of government revenue from energy tax, and (5) incentivizing ESCOs by government corporate tax exemption.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	8	1381-2386	1573-1596		WOS:000377920800001		J	Das, Pallavi; Sarma, Kali Prasad; Jha, Pawan Kumar; Ranjan, Rajnish; Herbert, Roger; Kumar, Manish					Kumar, Manish/0000-0002-3351-7298			Understanding the Cyclicity of Chemical Weathering and Associated CO2 Consumption in the Brahmaputra River Basin (India): The Role of Major Rivers in Climate Change Mitigation Perspective								AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY				22	3			225	251		10.1007/s10498-016-9290-6				JUN 2016	2016	Weathering of rocks that regulate the water chemistry of the river has been used to evaluate the CO2 consumption rate which exerts a strong influence on the global climate. The foremost objective of the present research is to estimate the chemical weathering rate (CWR) of the continental water in the entire stretch of Brahmaputra River from upstream to downstream and their associated CO2 consumption rate. To establish the link between the rapid chemical weathering and thereby enhance CO2 drawdown from the atmosphere, the major ion composition of the Brahmaputra River that drains the Himalaya has been obtained. Major ion chemistry of the Brahmaputra River was resolved on samples collected from nine locations in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons for two cycles: cycle I (2011-2012) and cycle II (2013-2014). The physico-chemical parameters of water samples were analysed by employing standard methods. The Brahmaputra River was characterized by alkalinity, high concentration of Ca2+ and HCO3 (-) along with significant temporal variation in major ion composition. In general, it was found that water chemistry of the river was mainly controlled by rock weathering with minor contributions from atmospheric and anthropogenic sources. The effective CO2 pressure (log) for pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon has been estimated. The question of rates of chemical weathering (carbonate and silicate) was addressed by using TDS and run-off (mm year(-1)). It has been found that the extent of CWR is directly dependent on the CO2 consumption rate which may be further evaluated from the perspective of climate change mitigation The average annual CO2 consumption rate of the Brahmaputra River due to silicate and carbonate weathering was found to be 0.52 (x10(6) mol Km(-2) year(-1)) and 0.55 (x10(6) mol Km(-2) year(-1)) for cycle I and 0.49 (x10(6) mol Km(-2) year(-1)) and 0.52 (x10(6) mol Km(-2) year(-1)) for cycle II, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of other Himalayan rivers. Estimation of CWR of the Brahmaputra River indicates that carbonate weathering largely dominates the water chemistry of the Brahmaputra River.									3	1	0	0	0	4	1	23	1380-6165	1573-1421		WOS:000376579000004		J	Stuart, Diana; Schewe, Rebecca L.

It examines how seed corn contracts in Michigan constrain the choices of farmers and allow farmers to rationalize the over-application of fertilizer and associated water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Seed corn contracts use a competitive "tournament" system where farmers are rewarded for maximizing yields. Interviews and a focus group were used to understand fertilizer over-application and barriers to participating in a climate change mitigation program. Results indicate that farmers agree that they over-apply fertilizer but would be unlikely to participate in a mitigation program due to their contracts and lack of support from seed corn companies. Because only a few companies control access to the seed corn market, farmers feel they have few choices. Farmers rationalized their practices as their only option given the competitive nature of their contracts and blamed other sources of pollution. Despite increasing efforts to educate farmers about climate change, structural barriers will continue to constrain participation in mitigation efforts and the development of a climate change ethic.									7	0	0	2	0	7	1	25	1187-7863	1573-322X		WOS:000376877700002		J	Hu, Wen-Cheng; Lin, Jui-Chu; Fan, Chien-Te; Lien, Chen-An; Chung, Shih-Ming								A booming green business for Taiwan's climate perspective								RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS				59				876	886		10.1016/j.rser.2016.01.024				JUN 2016	2016	Under the UNFCCC, governments have adopted a universal climate change agreement, the Paris Agreement, near the end of 2015 covering nearly all countries from 2020, and will endeavor to find ways to scale up efforts before 2020 beyond the existing pledges to curb emissions, so that the world can stay below the agreed maximum 2 degrees C temperature rise. In view of long-term planning strategy, many countries have adopted the year 2050 goals, and science strongly indicates that any further delay in appropriate global mitigation efforts will increase the pressure towards our low-carbon future. This paper discussed the multiple challenges and searches for the optimal pathways in promoting the transformation of future renewable energy systems in Taiwan, especially its practical implementation aspects. While developing Taiwan's climate legislation and strategies, in addition to having the participation of both the public and private sectors in order to act aggressively to overcome policy obstacles, active dialogues with the stakeholders and the general public were also promoted which helped to improve public awareness and build up consensus. The end result is the promulgation of the 2015 Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act which stipulates Taiwan's short and long term climate goals and development of corresponding measures, and the formulation of Taiwan's Nationally Determined Contribution which serves to foster a facilitative environment and create tremendous business opportunities for the booming green industry in Taiwan.

The key motivation for the promotion of these sources varies according to the countries; in some cases, the aim is to mitigate climate change, in some others is to address the growing energy demand, or to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels. To this purpose, governments implement different energy policies, based on a combination of primary and secondary instruments. Nevertheless, the performance of the policy will depend on the policy design and the enabling environment of the policy, e.g., macroeconomic conditions, political and regulatory risk, and financial sources. During the last decades, many Latin American and Caribbean countries have implemented energy policies to promote renewable electricity. Many of these countries have used a similar combination of support instruments (feed-in laws, targets, auctions, investment subsidies, etc.). However, the results are very dissimilar. In some cases, similar policies, and even the same instruments led to significant increases in renewable energies, while in other cases the impact has been very small. The aim of this study is to review the recent application of energy policies to renewable energies in a group of South American countries and to analyze whether the performance of the policy is due to policy incentives or enabling environment.

However, this view has been challenged in recent years. Carbon balances, cumulative radiative forcing, and average global temperature change have been calculated for a variety of bioenergy management regimes in Swedish forests, and the results support the view that an increased use of forest biomass for energy in Sweden can contribute to climate change mitigation, although methodological (e.g., spatial scales) and parameter value choices influence the results significantly. We show that the climate effect of forest-based bioenergy depends on the forest ecosystems and management, including biomass extraction for bioenergy and other products, and how this management changes in response to anticipated market demands; and on the energy system effects, which determine the fossil carbon displacement and other greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation effects of using forest biomass for bioenergy and other purposes. The public and private sectors are advised to consider information from comprehensive analyses that provide insights about energy and forest systems in the context of evolving forest product markets, alternative policy options, and energy technology pathways in their decision-making processes.

UUS has been long acknowledged to be important to the urban development agenda: sustainability, resilience, livability, and creating a better urban environment in particular. These issues are traditionally monitored using urban indicators, however UUS has not been properly included and considered in urban indicator lists (sets or systems) yet - the gap this paper is aiming to bridge. The paper reviews existing approaches to the composition of urban indicator lists, highlighting indicator types, challenges related to data collection, and agencies that are concerned with the issue. Further the paper has identified the importance of UUS inclusion in the lists that give integrated assessment and monitor urban sustainability, resilience, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as progress towards smart, livable, and compact cities. Existing global quantitative data on UUS have been examined in 8 cities; and three key indicators (descriptors) were suggested to monitor UUS use: Developed UUS volume (m(3)); UUS use density (m(3)/m(2)); and Developed UUS volume per person (m(3)/person). Current average UUS use densities in cities are identified as up to about 0.05 (m(3)/m(2)) (which can be interpreted as a virtual depth of UUS use of 5 cm), and the developed UUS volume per person is up to about 10 m(3)/person; while city central areas (central business districts) can have a virtual depth of developed UUS of several metres (m(3)/m(2)). Compatibility, comparability, uniformity, and sustained monitoring of urban indicators data (including UUS indicators) found to be posing significant challenges to the research across geographies, and industry/economic sectors.

Sustainable energy systems ensure fewer burdens on the environment and consequently provide success when fighting climate change. Energy policy provides support in addressing the present energy challenges. Municipal policy has often been neglected, with greater emphasis being concentrated at the centralised level. In addition, another identified problem has been the insufficient quality of the municipal policy performance with lack of acknowledging various features within the municipality. Therefore, the presented paper focuses on the constitution of municipal energy policies that include all aspects of municipalities' energy systems and lead towards less environmentally burdened energy systems. The main objective is to enhance sustainable development within municipalities through constitution and integration of suitable municipal energy policies. The proposed paper presents an entirely inclusive process for a municipal energy policy's institutional, implementation and evaluation phases. Municipal energy policy has to enable maximum efficiency of energy systems by implementing customised targets and measures. This novel methodology for integrated municipal energy policy constitution and integration has, in fact, been applied within the Podlehnik municipality, representing one of the small municipalities in Slovenia. This work proposes an important step towards formalising a municipal energy policy constitution and integration process.

This article presents the first quantitative review of the wider impacts on health and the environment likely to arise from action to meet the UK's legally-binding carbon budgets. Impacts were assessed for climate measures directed at power generation, energy use in buildings, and industry, transport, and agriculture. The study considered a wide range of health and environmental impacts including air pollution, noise, the upstream impacts of fuel extraction, and the lifestyle benefits of active travel. It was not possible to quantify all impacts, but for those that were monetized the co-benefits of climate action (i.e. excluding climate benefits) significantly outweigh the negative impacts, with a net present value of more than 85 pound billion from 2008 to 2030. Substantial benefits arise from reduced congestion, pollution, noise, and road accidents as a result of avoided journeys. There is also a large health benefit as a result of increased exercise from walking and cycling instead of driving. Awareness of these benefits could strengthen the case for more ambitious climate mitigation action.Policy relevanceThis article demonstrates that actions to mitigate GHG emissions have significant wider benefits for health and the environment. Including these impacts in cost-benefit analysis would strengthen the case for the UK (and similar countries) to set ambitious emissions reduction targets. Understanding co-benefits and trade-offs will also improve coordination across policy areas and cut costs. In addition, co-benefits such as air quality improvements are often immediate and local, whereas climate benefits may occur on a longer timescale and mainly in a distant region, as well as being harder to demonstrate. Dissemination of the benefits, along with better anticipation of trade-offs, could therefore boost public support for climate action.									7	0	0	1	0	7	0	52	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000373907500001		J	Kim, Tae Hyoung; Chae, Chang U.; Kim, Gil Hwan; Jang, Hyoung Jae								Analysis of CO2 Emission Characteristics of Concrete Used at Construction Sites								SUSTAINABILITY				8	4					UNSP 348	10.3390/su8040348				APR 2016	2016	As the greenhouse gas reduction goal of 37% below business-as-usual (BAU) by 2030, the construction industry is recognized as an anti-environment industry for mass consumption/mass waste; thus, members of the industry are requested to make efforts to transform it into an environment-friendly industry. Concrete, a common construction material, is known to emit large amounts of environmentally hazardous waste during the processes related to its production, construction, maintenance, and demolition. The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the product is specified in a ready-mixed concrete report whenever concrete is sold commercially. Hence, there have been many studies addressing the quantitative evaluation and reduction of the environmental effects of concrete. This study aims to introduce a method for assessing the amount of carbon dioxide emission from the processes of producing concrete. Moreover, we measured the quantities of CO2 emission of about 10 under-construction projects, including office buildings, apartment buildings, and high-rise residential buildings in South Korea. Using the assessment result, we analyzed the CO2 reduction performance of an office building in South Korea and drew conclusions about measures for reducing CO2 emission.									6	0	0	0	0	6	0	19	2071-1050			WOS:000375155800058		J	Taptich, Michael N.; Horvath, Arpad; Chester, Mikhail V.								Worldwide Greenhouse Gas Reduction Potentials in Transportation by 2050								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY				20	2			329	340		10.1111/jiec.12391				APR 2016	2016	Reductions in the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of passenger and freight transportation are possible through adoption of fuel-saving technologies, demand switching between modes, and large-scale electrification of fleets, in addition to other actions. In this study, future scenarios to 2030 and 2050 are the basis for assessment of GHG reduction potentials for major passenger and freight modes (automobiles, buses, trains, aircraft, and oceangoing vessels) across eight regions of the world. New fuel-saving technologies can significantly reduce the life-cycle GHG footprint of both passenger and freight vehicles, but not uniformly worldwide. Countries outside of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) lag behind OECD countries in GHG reduction potentials for all modes but oceangoing vessels owing to a combination of slower adoption of fuel-saving technologies and a slower decarbonization of electricity generation and other processes. The reduction of GHG intensity will occur more slowly for freight modes than for passenger modes. However, improved fuel efficiency has negative feedbacks to the effectiveness of mode-switching and alternative fuel adoption policies through 2050 because improvements in the fuel efficiency of vehicles alone may cause the marginal benefits of GHG abatement policies to diminish over time. This trend may be reversed if alternative fuel pathways decarbonize at faster rates than conventional transportation fuels. The largest opportunities for GHG reductions occur in non-OECD countries. Given the many factors that distinguish transportation systems between developed and developing nations (e.g., availability of new technologies, the financial ability to acquire them, and policies to incentivize their adoption), many benefits could be gained through interregional cooperation.									13	0	0	1	0	13	2	35	1088-1980	1530-9290		WOS:000374334400011		J	Sanchez, B.; Iglesias, A.; McVittie, A.; Alvaro-Fuentes, J.; Ingram, J.; Mills, J.; Lesschen, J.

Among them, the management of agricultural soils has a large potential for reducing GHG emissions or sequestering carbon. Many of the practices are based on well tested agronomic and technical know-how, with proven benefits for farmers and the environment. A suite of practices has to be used since none of the practices can provide a unique solution. However, there are limitations in the process of policy development: (a) agricultural activities are based on biological processes and thus, these practices are location specific and climate, soils and crops determine their agronomic potential; (b) since agriculture sustains rural communities, the costs and potential for implementation have also to be regionally evaluated and (c) the aggregated regional potential of the combination of practices has to be defined in order to inform abatement targets. We believe that, when implementing mitigation practices, three questions are important: Are they cost-effective for farmers? Do they reduce GHG emissions? What policies favour their implementation? This study addressed these questions in three sequential steps. First, mapping the use of representative soil management practices in the European regions to provide a spatial context to upscale the local results. Second, using a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) in a Mediterranean case study (NE Spain) for ranking soil management practices in terms of their cost-effectiveness. Finally, using a wedge approach of the practices as a complementary tool to link science to mitigation policy. A set of soil management practices was found to be financially attractive for Mediterranean farmers, which in turn could achieve significant abatements (e.g., 1.34 MtCO(2)e in the case study region). The quantitative analysis was completed by a discussion of potential farming and policy choices to shape realistic mitigation policy at European regional level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The article introduces the idea of a zero concept world where the global impact of the three specific sectors will be diminished. The paper analyses the actual status of each sector and identifies the main problems. It discusses and sets a road map to satisfy this objective, involving future quantitative and qualitative targets for the three considered sectors while it investigates the major technological, economic and social forces and policies that have to be employed in order to minimize the energy consumption of buildings, eradicate the energy poverty and mitigate the local climate change. The links, synergies and impacts between them are analysed in a comprehensive way and the interrelated nature and characteristics of the three sectors is highlighted. The mechanisms to transform the actual problems into opportunities and appropriate drivers for future development are identified and analysed. A road map involving a full estimation of the necessary investments to fulfil the defined targets is presented. The major medium and long term benefits for the society, including the impact on the economy, employment, the environment and health are fully quantified and analysed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments.Methods: Five European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys.Results: There are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied.Conclusions: The climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions. The health and wellbeing impacts varied and were often limited reflecting existing relatively high quality of life and environmental standards in most of the participating cities; the greatest potential for future health benefit occurs in less developed or developing countries.									18	0	0	5	0	18	1	58		1476-069X		WOS:000371896300001	26960925	J	de Serres, Alain; Murtin, Fabrice								Your Money or Your Life: Green Growth Policies and Welfare in 2050								ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS				63	3			571	590		10.1007/s10640-014-9849-x				MAR 2016	2016	This paper proposes a simple index of economic progress that weighs in the monetary cost induced by climate change mitigation policies as well as the health benefits arising from the reduction in local air pollution. The shadow price of pollution is calculated indirectly through its impact on life expectancy.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies have created interest in better understanding how public transit systems reduce emissions. Yet the use of average emission factors (e.g., grams CO(2)e per distance traveled) persists as the state-of-the-art masking the variations in emissions across time, and confounding the ability to accurately estimate the environmental effects from changes to transit infrastructure and travel behavior. An LCA is developed of the Expo light rail line and a competing car trip (in Los Angeles, California) that includes vehicle, infrastructure, and energy production processes, in addition to propulsion. When results are normalized per passenger kilometer traveled (PKT), life cycle processes increase energy use and GHG emissions up to 83%, and up to 690% for smog and respiratory impact potentials. However, the use of a time-independent PKT normalization obfuscates a decision-maker's ability to understand whether the deployment of a transit system reduces emissions below a future year policy target (e.g., 80% of 1990 emissions by 2050). The year-by-year marginal effects of the decision to deploy the Expo line are developed including reductions in automobile travel. The time-based marginal results provide clearer explanations for how environmental effects in a region change and the critical life-cycle processes that should be targeted to achieve policy targets. It shows when environmental impacts payback and how much reduction is achieved by a policy-specified future year. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Overview of automotive engine friction and reduction trends-Effects of surface, material, and lubricant-additive technologies								FRICTION				4	1			1	28		10.1007/s40544-016-0107-9				MAR 2016	2016	The increasing global environmental awareness, evidenced by recent worldwide calls for control of climate change and greenhouse emissions, has placed significant new technical mandates for automotives to improve engine efficiency, which is directly related to the production of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Reduction of parasitic losses of the vehicle, powertrain and the engine systems is a key component of energy conservation. For engine efficiency improvement, various approaches include improvements in advanced combustion systems, component system design and handling-such as down-sizing, boosting, and electrification-as well as waste heat recovery systems etc. Among these approaches, engine friction reduction is a key and relatively cost-effective approach, which has been receiving significant attention from tribologists and lubricant-lubrication engineers alike. In this paper, the fundamentals of friction specific to the environments of engine components tribology are reviewed, together with discussions on the impact of developing vehicle powertrain technologies, surface and material technologies, as well as lubricant and additive technologies on promises of continuing friction and wear reduction trends. The international accords on climate change require further gains in fuel efficiency and energy sustainability from all industry sectors including those in the automotive and the broader internal combustion engine industries, and the latter encompass off-highway, power generation, marine, and rail industries as well. This paper focsuses on friction reduction in mainly automotive engines, however.The paper starts with a clarification of the common descriptors of mechanical losses and friction in the engine, followed by the topic of lubrication fundamentals such as lubrication regimes. Then the lubrication of the contacting surfaces in each of the major engine subsystems is discussed in turn. These subsystems include the piston assembly: ring-pack/liner, piston-skirt/liner, and piston-pin/connecting-rod contacts; connecting rod and crankshaft bearings; and the valvetrain subsystem. The relative contributions to total friction from the various subsystems are discussed, with the piston-assembly contributing to about half of the total friction. The remainder of the friction comes from the crankshaft, connecting rod, camshaft bearings, and the valvetrain oscillating parts. The bearings are in predominantly hydrodynamic lubrication, in contrast to the valvetrain oscillating components, which are characterized to be mostly in the mixed/boundary lubrication regimes.Despite the title of the paper, a section on emerging powertrain technologies-including that of combustion in gasoline and diesel engines-is also given in the context of the trend towards clean and efficient propulsion systems. The impact of these developing technologies on the reduction of friction and parasitic losses via component, material, and lubricant deisgn will be discussed. These technologies include gasoline direct injection (GDI), turbocharged, and hybrid vehicles and will generate unique green environmental opportunities for future propulsion systems. These technologies are critical to meet fuel economy and reduced emission targets. Specifically, this paper will address the impact of these emerging technologies on future lubricant requirements and advanced tribology research. The connection between these lubricant and tribological requirements will beillustrated by briefly describing the basic lubrication and friction processes at the major engine components incorporating the emerging technologies.Lastly, besides new hardware and material science changes, several advanced additives such as advanced friction modifiers, antiwear additive chemistries, low viscosity lubricants, and the introduction of new VI Improvers all represent possible tribological solutions to the challenge of meeting more stringent energy efficiency requirements and environmental legislation. As original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) seek to accomplish these goals, hardware and emission system changes will place new demands and even greater stress on engine oils. At the same time, engine durability, performance and reliability are of primary importance to vehicle owners and operators. The final section of this paper will discuss the future trends of engine friction reduction and wear control by surface modification such as friction-reducing coatings or surface textures in engine components. The impact of surface coatings or surface textures on engine friction will be reviewed. In addition, the OEMs and lubricant formulation manufacturers will need to respond with novel engine oil technologies formulated to protect the engine, keeping the emissions system working at the optimal fuel economy, while retaining engine durability.In brief, the paper (i) reviews the characteristics of component friction in the environment of the internal combustion engine and the relevant design considerations, (ii) addresses the impact of emerging technologies on engine friction and the tribological changes and requirements, especially on lubricant and additives, and lastly (iii) discusses the interactions between lubricant-additive formulations and material surface engineering, and their effects on friction, wear and engine durability. The increasing importance and interplay between synergistic advancements in component design, material and surface engineering, and advanced lubricant-additive formulation will be fully illustrated.									54	9	0	0	0	58	6	137	2223-7690	2223-7704		WOS:000383012900001		J	Mercure, Jean-Francois; Pollitt, Hector; Bassi, Andrea.

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative, optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual influences among agents (multi-agent interactions) and capture related self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low carbon policies, (3) interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and (4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology is subsequently discussed by reference to four specific applications relating to each of the above areas: the diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. In conclusion, the article calls for a fundamental methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with that of the climatic system, fora combined and realistic understanding of the impact of sustainability policies.

Most theory and political discourse frames this divide as being driven by support for economy-driven environmental exploitation on the right. However, consistent with rhetoric characterizing environmentalists as "Communist watermelons" (i.e. green on the outside, red on the inside), we test an intergroup explanation for political polarization on climate change attitudes, with the perception that environmentalists are a threat to society also underlying right-wing climate change denial. In an American community sample (N = 384), environmentalist threat consistently, strongly, and uniquely accounted for the link between right-wing ideology and opposition to environmentalist policies and climate change denial, over and above views that the environment exists for economic exploitation and other relevant beliefs about the environment. Implications for encouraging climate change mitigation among right-wing adherents are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Discussing these complexities and the necessity to deal with them, this paper strives to help the country with a tool by introducing Richest Alternatives for Implementation to Supply Energy (RAISE), a mixed integer linear programming model developed by the means of GNUMathprog mathematical programming language. The paper fully elaborates authors' desired modeling mentality and formulations on which RAISE is programmed to work and verifies its structure by running a widely known sample case named "UTOPIA" and comparing the results with other works including OSeMOSYS and Temoa. The model applies RAISE model to Iranian energy sector to elicit optimal policy without and with a CO2 emission cap. The results suggest promotion of energy efficiency through investment on combined cycle power plants as the key to optimal policy in power generation sector. Regarding oil refining sector, investment on condensate refineries and advanced refineries equipped with Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) units are suggested. Results also undermine the prevailing supposition that climate change mitigation deteriorates economic efficiency of energy system and suggest that there is a strong synergy between them. In the case of imposing a CO2 cap that aims at maintaining CO2 emissions from electricity production activities at 2012 levels, a shift to renewable energies occurs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Institutions of all kinds, including rules and norms within political and energy systems, tend to have path-dependent qualities that make them difficult to change, whereas we also know that profound change has occurred in the past. Current decisions to pursue climate change mitigation by dramatically changing how energy is produced and used depend to some extent on finding the right enabling conditions for such change. The approach adopted here reveals the highly political and contingent nature of attempts to govern for innovations, how political institutions mediate differently between forces for sustainable change and forces for continuity, as well as specific interactions between governance and practice change within energy systems. It concludes that it is only by being specific about the contingent nature of governing for innovations, and about how this affects practices in energy systems differently, that those of us interested in sustainability can credibly advise policy makers and drive for greater change.

The burden of near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) generally has not been examined, despite evidence of a causal link with CHD.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the CHD burden from NRAP and compared it with the PM2.5 burden in the California South Coast Air Basin for 2008 and under a compact urban growth greenhouse gas reduction scenario for 2035.METHODS: We estimated the population attributable fraction and number of CHD events attributable to residential traffic density, proximity to a major road, elemental carbon (EC), and PM2.5 compared with the expected disease burden if the population were exposed to background levels of air pollution.RESULTS: In 2008, an estimated 1,300 CHD deaths (6.8% of the total) were attributable to traffic density, 430 deaths (2.4%) to residential proximity to a major road, and 690 (3.7%) to EC. There were 1,900 deaths (10.4%) attributable to PM2.5. Although reduced exposures in 2035 should result in smaller fractions of CHD attributable to traffic density, EC, and PM2.5, the numbers of estimated deaths attributable to each of these exposures are anticipated to increase to 2,500, 900, and 2,900, respectively, due to population aging. A similar pattern of increasing NRAP-attributable CHD hospitalizations was estimated to occur between 2008 and 2035.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a large burden of preventable CHD mortality is attributable to NRAP and is likely to increase even with decreasing exposure by 2035 due to vulnerability of an aging population. Greenhouse gas reduction strategies developed to mitigate climate change offer unexploited opportunities for air pollution health co-benefits.									10	0	0	5	0	10	2	35	0091-6765	1552-9924		WOS:000369337900012	26149207	J	Malico, I.; Carrajola, J.; Gomes, C.

It focuses on the combined assessment of biomass availability, techno-economic feasibility and environmental aspects of utilizing forest and agricultural residues to produce bioheat. At first, the energy potential of the residual biomass available in the municipality is evaluated using a geographical information system database. The assessment with RETScreen of the techno-economic feasibility of replacing electricity by biomass for heating local public schools follows. The results show that around 27 314 t of residues, corresponding to about 267 680 GJ, are produced each year in Estremoz, more than half in montado areas. The use of this biomass for the replacement of the existing electric heating systems of nine local schools by biomass-based ones offers good project profitability. As far as the environment is concerned, the energetic valorization of the residual biomass in Estremoz has multiple benefits. It contributes to climate change mitigation by saving greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the preservation of the traditional extensive uses of the ecosystems. Moreover, a correct vegetation management decreases the fire risk, potentiates the increase in biodiversity, offers better conditions for native species and allows to maintain the ecosystems.

In the Municipality of Solrod in Denmark, a novel bioenergy concept for anaerobic co-digestion of food industry residues, manure and beach-cast seaweed has been developed and tested in order to quantify the potential for synergies between climate change mitigation and coastal eutrophication management in the Koge Bay catchment. The biogas plant, currently under construction, was designed to handle an annual input of up to 200,000 t of biomass based on four main fractions: pectin wastes, carrageenan wastes, manure and beach-cast seaweed. This paper describes how this bioenergy concept can contribute to strengthening the linkages between climate change mitigation strategies and Water Framework Directive (WFD) action planning. Our assessments of the projected biogas plant indicate an annual reduction of GHG emissions of approx. 40,000 t CO2 equivalents, corresponding to approx. 1/3 of current total GHG emissions in the Municipality of Solrod. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorous loads to Koge Bay are estimated to be reduced by approx. 63 t yr.(-1) and 9 t yr.(-1), respectively, contributing to the achievement of more than 70% of the nutrient reduction target set for Koge Bay in the first WFD river basin management plan. This study shows that anaerobic co-digestion of the specific food industry residues, pig manure and beach-cast seaweed is feasible and that there is a very significant, cost-effective GHG and nutrient loading mitigation potential for this bioenergy concept. Our research demonstrates how an integrated planning process where considerations about the total environment are integrated into the design and decision processes can support the development of this kind of holistic bioenergy solutions.

Climate change having adverse effect on agriculture and traditional practices followed are planting, fertilizing and harvesting against the predetermined schedule. Precision agriculture can be used to mitigate the climate change. The work objective is optimal usage of water in irrigation, proper nutrient management to plant and avoid crop losses due to diseases and pests with proper scheduling of sprays. In this context, we have proposed an agro advisory system for the pomegranate field. Wireless sensor network is deployed on field and will continuously monitoring real time environmental, soil, hydrological and crop specific parameters. Those are important for growth, productivity and quality in agriculture. An agro advisory will be disseminated to the farmers according to real time field conditions via SMS and email. The experimental result analysis of proposed system shows improvement over traditional followed methods.

TheScientificWorldJournal				2016				6523217	6523217						2016	2016	Currently in many cities and rural areas of Vietnam, wastewater is discharged to the environment without any treatment, which emits considerable amount of greenhouse gas (GHG), particularly methane. In this study, four GHG emission scenarios were examined, as well as the baseline scenario, in order to verify the potential of GHG reduction from domestic wastewater with adequate treatment facilities. The ArcGIS and ArcHydro tools were employed to visualize and analyze GHG emissions resulting from discharge of untreated wastewater, in rural areas of Vu Gia Thu Bon river basin, Vietnam. By applying the current IPCC guidelines for GHG emissions, we found that a reduction of GHG emissions can be achieved through treatment of domestic wastewater in the studied area. Compared with baseline scenario, a maximum 16% of total GHG emissions can be reduced, in which 30% of households existing latrines are substituted by Japanese Johkasou technology and other 20% of domestic wastewater is treated by conventional activated sludge.									0	0	0	0	0	0	1	7		1537-744X		MEDLINE:27699202	27699202	S	Creutzig, Felix; Fernandez, Blanca; Haberl, Helmut; Khosla, Radhika; Mulugetta, Yacob; Seto, Karen C.

However, many solutions to climate change mitigation misalign with such analytical frameworks. Here, we examine demand-side solutions, a crucial class of mitigation options that go beyond technological specification and cost-benefit analysis. To do so, we synthesize demand-side mitigation options in the urban, building, transport, and agricultural sectors. We also highlight the specific nature of demand-side solutions in the context of development. We then discuss key analytical considerations to integrate demand-side options into overarching assessments on mitigation. Such a framework would include infrastructure solutions that interact with endogenous preference formation. Both hard infrastructures, such as the built environment, and soft infrastructures, such as habits and norms, shape behavior and as a consequence offer significant potential for reducing overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that systemic infrastructural and behavioral change will likely be a necessary component of a transition to a low-carbon society.									41	0	0	3	0	41	1	15	1543-5938		978-0-8243-2341-7	WOS:000398214100007		J	Newell, Joshua P.; Henry, Laura A.

This paper reviews the state of the environment by assessing post-Soviet era changes to legislation, government regulatory institutions, and civil society. A gulf exists between Russia's formal environmental laws and state agency capacity and interest in enforcing them. This stems, in part, from repeated bureaucratic reorganizations that have progressively eroded environmental institutions. The Russian environmental movement, which blossomed during Gorbachev's reforms in the late 1980s, struggled in the 1990s to mobilize the broader public due to economic hardship and political instability. Since then, the Putin administration has labeled many environmental groups "anti-Russian" and used aggressive tactics such as raiding NGO offices, intimidating journalists, and instituting severe legislative measures to quash advocacy and dissent. Post-Soviet environmental successes have been relatively few, with expansion of the protected area system and forest certification notable exceptions. These successes can partially be attributed to efforts by large environmental organizations, but expansion of certification and corporate social responsibility is also tied to Russian business interests dependent on natural resource export to global markets increasingly sensitive to environmental concerns. The paper concludes by illustrating how corruption, poor enforcement, and the muzzling of civil society render the state incapable of resolving arguably its most significant environmental challenge: illegal and unregulated resource use.									5	0	1	1	0	6	2	15	1538-7216	1938-2863		WOS:000398228200006		J	Lee, Paul Tae-Woo; Chung, Yi-Shih; Lam, Jasmine Siu Lee								Transportation research trends in environmental issues: a literature review of methodology and key subjects								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SHIPPING AND TRANSPORT LOGISTICS				8	6	SI		612	631		10.1504/IJSTL.2016.079249				2016	2016	Environmental issues have been a popular topic in various academic research areas including transportation. The aim of this paper is to identify major environmental research topics and research methods in the transportation field and thereby explore possible global research agenda. This paper selected a total of 1,291 papers from 51 journals based on keywords including both transport and environment. The literature survey shows that the number of environmental issue papers published in transportation journals has been growing significantly since 2007. Greenhouse gas emission is among the hottest topic in our literature survey. Little environmental research was conducted regarding maritime transport, as compared to passenger, land and aviation sectors. In terms of popular methodologies adopted to tackle environmental issues in the transportation journals, the top three methods are emission analysis, survey and simulation. There is plenty of room in conducting future transportation research in environmental topics, particularly in the maritime field.

Specifically, among the compromises acquired by the EEA and the ETC/ACM, there is the management and quality checking of all the information reported by the Member States to fulfil the Environmental Noise Directive requirements. This paper presents main figures concerning strategic noise maps at European level, with the focus on noise exposure to the different noise sources as well as on the noise contour maps. Specificities that could be observed in Southern European countries are highlighted, mainly related to differences encountered if reported information is compared across Europe.					23rd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)23rd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 10-14, 2016JUL 10-14, 2016	Hellenic Assoc Toll Road Network; Dynam Acoust S A; Traffic Transportat & Environm Consultants S A; ACCON GmbH; T & S Technologies Grp; OROS; PEMARD; Vibro Acoust; AKTOR; APION KLEOS CJV; TERNAHellenic Assoc Toll Road Network; Dynam Acoust S A; Traffic Transportat & Environm Consultants S A; ACCON GmbH; T & S Technologies Grp; OROS; PEMARD; Vibro Acoust; AKTOR; APION KLEOS CJV; TERNA	Athens, GREECEAthens, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	2329-3675		978-960-99226-2-3	WOS:000388480404090		J	Richter, Holger								Stretching the Arch Metallographic Analysis of a broken Crossbow Arch								WAFFEN-UND KOSTUMKUNDE				58	1			43	48						2016	2016	This article presents the results of a metallographic analysis of a broken steel bow for a crossbow. The bow came from a traditional cranequin crossbow, which was used by a member of the civic crossbow shooting society in Weimar (dissolved in 1945). The fragment from the depot of the city museum Weimar could not be dated exactly, but comes certainly from a traditional crossbow, which was bent by winder. Some of the Weimar crossbowmen used very old weapons from the 16th / 17th centuries, which have been repeatedly repaired. The steel bow fragment (fig. 1) has a total length of 320 mm with a cross section at the fracturing point near the center of 39.4 x 12.5 mm and a rectangular cross section before the string notches of 28.6 x 7.4 mm. The bow consists of fire welded layers and basically there is a ferritic-pearlitic structure with different portions of pearlite (fig. 2, 3). About 30 layers are visible (fig. 7). The hardness profile (fig. 4), determined by the Vickers method [test force of 20 N (HV 2), measuring distance of 0.5 min] shows the small side of the cross section near to the center. Here the hardness of a soft spring steel is recognizable. Slag inclusions with decarburized environment gives a conclusive indication of the fracture cause (fig. 5, 6). On the micrographs is exemplary to see a variety of slag inclusions of varying size and shape. In part, the environment of the slag inclusions strongly decarbonized due to decarbonization effect of slag on the surrounding matrix. In summary it can be said that the bow consists of forge welded alternating soft and hard steel layers and the fracture was caused by nonmetallic inclusions. In today's steel production significantly higher levels of purity can be achieved by other technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0042-9945			WOS:000393538300002		S	Guerra, Flavia						Primorac, Z; Bussoli, C; Recker, N		GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS FOR OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY								ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT (ESD)		International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development						529	540						2016	2016	As potential contributors to climate change mitigation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and drivers of economic growth, harnessing offshore renewable energies (ORE) depends on safe and reliable technology, appropriate policy and regulatory instruments, and stable sources of funding. However, the nature, location and maturity of ORE have led to several legal and policy challenges which condition the success of these industries.Even though the ability to generate electricity from marine renewables is not in question, since technology is moving ahead of policy, its integration in wider energy networks might be problematic given the localised nature of the resources, and the high variability/low predictability of their output over multiple timescales.Limited practical experience with the deployment of these technologies coupled with the difficulty of studying the marine environment represent barriers to acquiring knowledge on their impacts, particularly wave and tidal energy. These data gaps are amplified by underdeveloped regulatory frameworks regarding marine planning and sitting processes, including Environmental Impact Assessment, not adapted to manage uncertainty, and often making it too difficult for potential developers to get consent and thus invest.As part of EU's Blue Growth Strategy, ORE's demand for exclusive rights over resources and a marine space creates potential conflicts by entering already congested oceans, traditionally regulated in a single-sector manner for different marine activities.Previously proposed solutions to these constraints have failed to acknowledge the combined importance of all types of environmental policy instruments: evolving legal frameworks, targets and commitments; practical differences in domestic implementation of regulation, market-based and suasive instruments; and fragmentation of institutional architectures associated with constantly evolving actor networks operating for ORE governance. Studying policy instrument mixes might demonstrate the changing roles of state and societal actors, and ultimately contribute for the debate surrounding the sustainability and governance transition to renewable energy.					16th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development - The Legal Challenges of Modern World16th International Scientific Conference on Economic and Social Development - The Legal Challenges of Modern World	SEP 01-02, 2016SEP 01-02, 2016	Varazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ Split, Fac Law; Univ NVarazdin Dev & Entrepreneurship Agcy; Univ Split, Fac Law; Univ N	Split, CROATIASplit, CROATIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	10	1849-6903	1849-7535	*****************	WOS:000391254400054		S	Grbic, Milena; Lazovic, Zoran; Djokic, Vladan			SGEM	Grbic, Milena/S-5895-2017; Lazovic, Zoran/U-5734-2017	Grbic, Milena/0000-0001-6485-1478; Lazovic, Zoran/0000-0003-1180-4461			POTENTIALS OF CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION INSIDE UNPLANNED SETTLEMENTS IN BELGRADE								ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, SGEM 2016, VOL II		International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference-SGEM						499	506						2016	2016	The purpose of this article is to highlight the fact that unplanned settlements as environments, despite the professional designing ignorance, contain as part of their context certain methodological, design and cultural premises, embodied in spatial forms and unplanned settlement construction manners that all together have direct potential to offer design responses to climate change that can be applied for the advancement of housing to create healthier, safer, more durable environments.Methodologically, the paper begins with an interpretation that suggests that the physical spatial patterns of unplanned settlements were created without professional influence and represent a quality formed by traditional construction knowledge induced by the need to functionally organize a community where everyday activities take place. In such spirit, the man and nature relation inside these settlements is already existent which enables a variation of the produced spatial research (house and settlement) in ecology terms. So, it is possible to systematize inside a settlement a base of characters of physical structure that hold a potential for further designing and culturally acceptable advancements of housing, which at the same time integrate recommendations in taking concrete actions to enhance the possibility of adapting this space by existent and also reduce spatial vulnerability by future climate changes.The study is based on multiple methods which include a case study of their manifestation in representative spatial typology of unplanned settlements in Belgrade, Serbia.The purpose of the paper is firstly to emphasize the fact that microenvironments like this already offer their own ways to participate in the creation of cities of the future. Drawing attention to very concrete resources of unplanned settlement communities which integrate responses to changing climatic conditions such as flooding, extreme storms and extreme heat, has high effect: it will be very useful for the replication and advancement of efforts for the shaping (operationalization) of innovative strategies which will provide reasonably affordable housing to the population that it Will serve when it comes to housing advancement.					16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)	JUN 30-JUL 06, 2016JUN 30-JUL 06, 2016	Bulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Lett; Acad Sci Moldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environm & WaterBulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Lett; Acad Sci Moldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environm & Water	Albena, BULGARIAAlbena, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1314-2704		978-619-7105-64-3	WOS:000391348700064		S	Lazovic, Zoran; Grbic, Milena; Djokic, Vladan			SGEM	Lazovic, Zoran/U-5734-2017; Grbic, Milena/S-5895-2017	Lazovic, Zoran/0000-0003-1180-4461; Grbic, Milena/0000-0001-6485-1478			THE DISSOCIATION FROM THE GIDDENS PARADOX IN HOUSING ARCHITECTURE IN SERBIA								ENERGY AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, SGEM 2016, VOL II		International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference-SGEM						615	622						2016	2016	The intent of this paper is to record concrete attributes and demonstrate the urgency that the practice of applying measurements of climate change mitigation and prevention must include the reform of bad positions that have appeared and that were nurtured in housing architecture in Serbia, by a procedure made of correct, aimed and very precise mechanisms and adequate measures with a small consumption of means, having in mind hard present conditions.The paper starts based on the problem that Serbia is now facing a new legalization wave of illegal housing objects that is threatening to enable a legal existence of over 1.5 million buildings that are very vulnerable and under any standard in the context of climate change. The methodology of this study is to, through contemporary key terms and phenomenon of climate change, vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation (that are well known in theory, but not implemented in practice), provide an access into the existing state of the built environment, and based on a comparative analysis to valorize and systematize this discrepancy. This rendering that explicitly quantifies vulnerable places might have the strength to encourage more serious considerations of the processes that are occurring in Serbia and also in environments that toughly and stubbornly hang on to the highest standards of constructing in the spirit of climate change prevention and mitigation, but to also clearly profile recommendations in solving existing and future climate changes.The contribution of this study is seen in formulating successful anticipations and visions of the ecological, bioclimatic and energetic aspect of reconstructing problematical housing fund in Serbia. As an admonition, the paper also indicates on the necessity of an awakening of individuals, groups and organizations, and on the encouragement and exchange of information and experiences to improve individual and collective knowledge and to affirm an informatively-creative, developmentally-encouraging, and artistically-creative approach of initiating various actions that are in relation to present ecological problems. In applying such a procedure it is possible to provide a base to diminish the gap between conscientious states and Serbia and that living in Serbia should not be shadowed by the fact that it is becoming socially unacceptable.					16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)	JUN 30-JUL 06, 2016JUN 30-JUL 06, 2016	Bulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Lett; Acad Sci Moldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environm & WaterBulgarian Acad Sci; Acad Sci Czech Republ; Latvian Acad Sci; Polish Acad Sci; Russian Acad Sci; Serbian Acad Sci & Arts; Slovak Acad Sci; Natl Acad Sci Ukraine; Inst Water Problem & Hydropower NAS KR; Natl Acad Sci Armenia; Sci Council Japan; World Acad Sci; European Acad Sci Arts & Lett; Acad Sci Moldova; Montenegrin Acad Sci & Arts; Croatian Acad Sci & Arts; Georgian Natl Acad Sci; Acad Fine Arts & Design Bratislava; Turkish Acad Sci; Bulgarian Ind Assoc; Bulgarian Minist Environm & Water	Albena, BULGARIAAlbena, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1314-2704		978-619-7105-64-3	WOS:000391348700079		J	Han, Sangwoon								Integration of North and South Korea Marine Environmental Legislation and Its Challenges			통일대비 남북한 해양환경법제의 통합 및 과제					Environmental Law Review	환경법연구			38	3			109	141						2016	2016	The guideline for modification of marine environment-related legal system regarding the way to improve marine environmental legislation in preparation for unification is as follows: First, marine environmental policy in the period of unification should accord with the principle of sustainable development and environmental justice for the Korean Peninsula. In terms of marine environmental policy, it should legalize the Korea Peninsula’s sustainable marine environmental policy by considering preferential treatment for marine environment in North Korea and next generations.Second, it should clarify a range of marine environmental legislation and its limitation, and it needs to resolve overlapping and contradictory fields by considering it organically in connection with other related laws.Third, environmental matters are worldwide concerns and its mediation issue is climate change. Therefore, greenhouse gas reduction for climate change mitigation in marine environment and marine climate change adaptation policy in response to sea level rise on the Korea peninsular need to be legalized by systematically setting up marine related multilateral environmental agreements.Fourth, related ordinances should be codified in accordance with the prevention principle and the precautionary principle by considering physical properties of the sea instead of a reactive action.Fifth, it is efficient to establish marine environmental policy associated with land environmental protection. Though land based marine pollution has been aggravated, the systematic legal basis to alleviate it is inadequate in South Korea. In preparation for unification, it is required to codify legislation to efficiently manage the marine environment of the Korean Peninsular in associated with land environment.Based on the guideline, it also needs to reform marine environmental legal system in preparation for unification. Through tentatively named “Framework Act on the Sustainable Development for the Korea Peninsula” it should secure sustainability on the Korean Peninsular considering environment, economy and social equity, and on the basis of that, ‘Framework Act on Environmental Policy’ should be newly enacted or overall revised to proceed to integrated marine environmental policy with land environment as a fundamental law in an ‘environment’ field.In addition, ‘Marine Environment Management Act’ needs to be enacted to provide a guideline, principles and fundamental matters in marine environmental field by considering consistency of marine environmental policy and distinctiveness of the sea. As for individual laws, ‘Marine Oil Pollution Prevention And Management Act’, ‘Marine Ecosystem Conservation and Management Act’, ‘Endangered Marine Species of Flora and Fauna Conservation Act’, ‘Wetland and Tideland Protection Act’, ‘Coast Management Act’, ‘Korea Marine Environment Management Corporation Act’ and ‘Korea Coast Guard Act’, etc., should be modified.				남북해양환경법제 통합은 통일국가 이전의 화해ㆍ협력의 단계와 남북연합단계로 나누어 단계별 목표를 설정하고 관련입법의 통합을 추진할 필요가 있다. 즉 제1단계인 화해ㆍ협력의 단계에서는 해양환경을 위한 남북공동협력사업의 시행과 민간교류 확대를 위한 근거법령을 마련하고, 제2단계인 남북연합단계에서는 해양환경에 관한 남북법제통합을 실현하는 것이다.그리고 해양환경통합법제는 남북한 전역에 걸쳐 적용되는 것이 원칙이지만 북한의 해양환경오염이 특히 심각한 지역이나 생태계 보고 등 해양환경보전의 시급성이 요구되는 지역인 경우 등에는 특정 지역에 한정하여 우선적으로 법제통합을 하고 그 시행도 즉각적으로 할 수 있다.또한 남한 해양환경법제의 북한지역으로의 확장 적용이 남북한 법제통합의 기본원칙이라고 볼 수 있다. 다만 확장적용을 한다고 하더라도 남한법의 북한지역에의 적용은 당연히 일정기간 유보기간을 설정하여 한시적으로 북한법의 적용을 인정하는 과도기간의 설정이 요구된다.현행 남한의 해양환경법제는 여러 가지 문제점이 지적되어 왔으며, 따라서 과도기 이후에 남한의 해양환경관련 법제를 북한지역에 적용하는 경우 현행 남한 해양환경관련법제가 지니고 있는 문제점을 사전에 해소하고, 확장ㆍ적용할 필요가 있다.통일대비 해양환경 관련 법체계의 방향은 다음의 몇 가지 원칙에 따라야 한다. 첫째, 통일시대의 해양환경정책은 “한반도의 환경정의와 지속가능발전원칙”에 부합하여야 한다. 해양환경정책에 있어서도 북한의 해양환경에 대한 우선적 배려와 후세대를 고려한 한반도 지속가능한 해양환경정책이 법제화되어야 한다. 둘째, 해양환경법제의 범위와 한계를 명확히 하고, 중첩ㆍ모순되는 분야는 관련법과의 유기적 연관성을 고려하여 입법적으로 해소할 필요가 있다. 셋째, 환경문제는 지구적 관심사이면 그 주된 매개이슈는 기후변화이다. 따라서 해양환경에 있어서 기후대응을 위한 온실가스저감 및 한반도 해수면상승 등 기후적응을 위한 한반도 해양기후대응 정책은 기후변화 등 해양환경관련 국제협약의 내용이 체계적으로 정립되어 법제화될 필요가 있다. 넷째, 해양의 물리적 특성 등을 고려하여 사후대응 방식이 아닌 사전예방 및 사전배려의 원칙에 따라 관련 법령의 체계화를 하여야 한다. 다섯째, 육상환경보호와 연계된 해양환경정책이 효율적이라는 점에서 육상기인 해양오염을 완화시킬 수 있는 법제 마련이 필요하다.통일대비 해양환경관련법체계는 다음과 같이 제시될 수 있다. 환경과 경제, 그리고 사회형평성을 고려한 “한반도 지속가능발전기본법”(가칭)을 제정하여 한반도의 지속가능발전을 확보하여야 한다. 그리고 이에 터잡아 ‘환경’분야의 기본법으로서 육상환경과의 통합적 해양환경정책을 추진하기 위한 “환경정책기본법”을 전면개정할 필요가 있다. 그리고 해양환경정책의 일관성과 해양의 특수성을 고려하여 해양환경분야의 기본방향과 원칙, 그리고 해양환경관리를 위한 기본적 사항을 규정하는 “해양환경관리기본법”을 제정할 필요가 있다. 그리고 개별법으로서 “해양유류오염방지 및 관리법”, “해양생태계 보전 및 관리법”, “멸종위기 해양 동ㆍ식물종의 보존에 관한 법률”, “습지 및 갯벌보호법”, “연안관리법” “해양환경공단법 및 해양경찰법 등 조직법 정비”등이 기본적으로 필요하다고 본다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1225-116X			KJD:ART002170187		J	Alizadeh, Reza; Majidpour, Mehdi; Maknoon, Reza; Kaleibari, Saeed Shafiei				Alizadeh, Reza/V-9942-2017	Alizadeh, Reza/0000-0002-7705-8943; Majidpour, Mehdi/0000-0002-6805-2419; Shafiei Kaleibari, Saeed/0000-0002-6194-9821			Clean development mechanism in Iran: does it need a revival?								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING				10	1-3	SI		196	215		10.1504/IJGW.2016.077913				2016	2016	This paper aimed to study clean development mechanism (CDM) projects in Iran. Greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are generally considered costly with world leaders often engaging in debate concerning the costs of mitigation and the distribution of these costs between different countries. CDM projects are useful tools to reduce these costs. Kyoto Protocol includes three mechanisms, namely: emission trading, joint implementation and CDM. CDM is the only mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in which developing countries can participate. Comprehensive interviews with experts from Iranian oil and energy ministries and Department of Environment (DOE) resulted in detecting the missed opportunities for CDM in Iran. Lack of long term planning for the Kyoto Protocol, limitation of technology and finance, lack of regulation and functionality of a financial system and international sanctions are the most significant obstacles for implementation of CDM projects in Iran. At the end, a comprehensive analysis for utilising CDM to greenhouse gas reduction and climate change mitigation is presented.									2	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	1758-2083	1758-2091		WOS:000389720600011		J	김재근								Development of a high school education program on climate change responses by applying a scenario planning			시나리오 플래닝을 적용한 기후 변화 대응 교육프로그램 개발					School Science Journal	현장과학교육			10	3			222	235						2016	2016	We developed a high school education program on climate change responses: mitigation and adaptation, in which students predict effects of climate change on life and find creative and self-directed ways to respond to it by applying a scenario planning. The program consisted of 10 periods: students explored the causes of climate change, phenomena, and effects and then they creatively proposed the ways of climate change mitigation and adaptation in dietary life and health and environment by using TAIDA, which is a kind of scenario planning. The program was revised through a validity test of high school teachers and completed after applying to 15 high school students in Incheon. They showed positive responses about teaching and learning strategies, contents of climate change and systematic teaching processes and expected that it will help them improve their creativity stimulating divergent thinking. Planning a future scenario of climate change increased an awareness of serious climate change and led them to think about efforts to climate change adaptation. This study has significance for applying future education to climate change education using a scenario planning and differs from other programs in that it focuses on climate change adaptation and makes students think ways to respond to it on their own.				본 연구는 시나리오 플래닝을 적용하여 학생들이 창의적이고 자기주도적으로 기후 변화가 생활에 미치는 영향을 예측하고 이에 대한 대응을 할 수 있는 방법을 찾는 고등학생 대상 기후 변화 대응 교육 프로그램을 개발하는데 있다. 개발된 프로그램은 총 10차시로 1~4차시는 기후 변화의 원인, 현상, 영향을 탐색하도록 하였고 5~10차시는 기후 변화 완화, 식생활과 보건 환경에 대한 기후 변화 적응 방법을 Lindgren와 Bandhold(2002)의 TAIDA를 이용하여 창의적으로 제시할 수 있도록 구성되었다. 개발한 교육 프로그램은 현직 교사의 타당도 조사를 거쳐 수정, 보완하였고 이를 인천광역시 소재 일반고등학교 과학동아리 학생 15명에게 예비 적용한 후 수정하여 완성하였다. 학생들은 프로그램의 교수 학습 전략, 기후 변화 교육 내용, 수업 진행의 체계성에 대해 긍정적인 반응을 보였고, 개발한 교육 프로그램이 발산적 사고를 촉진하여 창의력 향상에 도움이 될 것이라고 기대하였다. 기후 변화에 대한 미래 시나리오를 작성하는 것은 기후 변화에 대해 심각성을 높이는 인식의 변화를 가지게 하였고 기후 변화 대응을 위한 노력이 필요하다는 생각을 갖게 하였다. 개발된 프로그램은 시나리오 플래닝을 이용해 기후 변화 교육에 미래 교육을 적용했다는 점에서 의미를 가지며, 기후 변화 대응에 초점을 두어 그 방법을 학생들 스스로 찾아낼 수 있도록 한다는 점에서 기존의 개발된 프로그램과 차별성을 가진다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2093-7407			KJD:ART002164690		S	Djojodihardjo, Harijono						Lie, TT; Eissa, M; Calabro, E		Conceptual Design of a Medium-Sized Combined Smart Photovoltaic - Agriculture System - Case Study in Malaysia								2016 ASIA CONFERENCE ON POWER AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ACPEE 2016)		MATEC Web of Conferences		55						UNSP 06013	10.1051/matecconf/20165506013				2016	2016	With the backdrop of sustainable environment, Photo-Voltaic Power System linked to Climate-Smart Agriculture may offer solutions for Sustainable Energy, Climate Change mitigation and Sustainable Agriculture.

In outlining the prima facie case, this article discusses the key areas of concern surrounding REDD+ and the repercussions for the rights and interests of local forest and indigenous communities. Furthermore, in its discussion on why REDD+ necessitates a HRIA, the article explores the implications that a specific link between human rights and REDD+ would have on the promotion and protection of forest peoples and indigenous human rights. In the context of the climate change crisis, formulating a specific link between human rights and climate change mitigation strategies such as REDD+ is highly pertinent if they are to have a positive impact at a local level. Formulating this connection could potentially secure the protection of traditional knowledge, law, customs and lands of those communities in which it operates, ensuring that the most vulnerable and poorest members of society do not bare the negative costs of such policies.									3	0	0	0	0	3	1	8	1364-2987	1744-053X		WOS:000387544300004		B	Kadlubek, Marta						Kovarova, E; Melecky, L; Stanickova, M		Chosen Theoretical and Practical Areas of Green Logistics Management in Transport Sector in European Union								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EUROPEAN INTEGRATION 2016 (ICEI 2016)								407	414						2016	2016	As environment matter has turn into significant concern, the idea of green logistics is escalating appreciably in reference to deliberation and lessening the negative environmental effects of logistics. Green logistics areas are anticipated to identify with the attempts to scrutinize appropriate ways concentrated on the balance between environmental protection and efficiency. The first chapter of the paper concerns recognition of the green logistics concept in theoretical aspects of its definition and function. Then chosen areas of green logistics in the view of European Union statistical data and obligations are presented. Specially transportation as the core source of environmental threats in the logistic system seems to be important and necessity of decarbonisation of the transport sector in reference to green logistics which may imply more public rail transportation solutions.					3rd International Conference on European Integration (ICEI)3rd International Conference on European Integration (ICEI)	MAY 19-20, 2016MAY 19-20, 2016	Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European IntegratTech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat	Ostrava, CZECH REPUBLICOstrava, CZECH REPUBLIC	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1			978-80-248-3911-0	WOS:000387986300045		S	Seo, Ho-Hyong; Lee, Dong-Eun; Kim, Byung-Soo						Drusa, M; Yilmaz, I; Marschalko, M; Coisson, E; Segalini, A		Development of Eco-VE Function for Construction								WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING-ARCHITECTURE-URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM 2016, WMCAUS 2016		Procedia Engineering		161				738	746		10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.759				2016	2016	Recently accepted "Paris Agreement" has restricted the Earth temperature increase to be below 1.5 degrees Celsius contrast to previous industrialization. To follow this agreement, there should be efforts such as carbon emission reduction and eco design etc. One of these efforts is development of eco-VE function that applied eco-friendly concept on VE which is commonly used at design phase. Concept of this model includes carbon productivity concept and potential environment pollution index that reflects eco-VE function on original VE. The carbon productivity concept is a cause of production increase that offset production decrease factor depending on green-house gas reduction. The potential environment pollution index presents the possibility of environment pollution through construction phase. The carbon productivity is 'Construction cost/Carbon emission'. The construction costs are consisted of material, equipment, labour cost and indirect expenses. Carbon emissions are calculated by emission for material production and equipment fuel consumption. The potential environment pollution index is composed of environmental pollution and conservation cost. The environmental pollution cost includes environmental damage and destruction cost. The environmental conservation cost includes environmental pollution prevention cost, waste treatment cost, environmental pollution compensation, environmental pollution test research funds and law cost.

However, such monitoring systems are expensive and-especially in times of economic weakness-budgets for science and environmental policy are under particular scrutiny. In this study, we attempt to demonstrate the magnitude of benefits of improved information about actual carbon fluxes. Such information enables better-informed policy-making and thus paves the way for a more secure investment environment when decarbonizing the energy sector. The numerical results provide a robust indication of a positive social value of improving carbon monitoring systems when compared to their cost, especially for the more ambitious climate policies.									1	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	2332-2039			WOS:000385667500001		J	Saayman, Melville; Krugell, Waldo; Saayman, Andrea				Saayman, Andrea/A-1603-2018	Saayman, Andrea/0000-0002-9506-8141; saayman, melville/0000-0001-9991-0140; Krugell, Waldo/0000-0002-7815-6529			CHARACTERISATION OF CYCLISTS' WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR GREEN INITIATIVES AT AFRICA'S LARGEST CYCLE TOUR								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES				19	3			432	447		10.17159/2222-3436/2016/v19n3a9				2016	2016	The Cape Argus Pick n Pay Cycle Tour is a major event on the road cycling calendar. The majority of cyclists travel significant distances and participation produces a substantial carbon footprint. This paper examines participants' willingness to pay to offset their carbon footprint. The purpose of this paper is to make a contribution to the literature by linking willingness to pay to attitudes towards or beliefs ( green views) about the initiatives in place, to ensure a greener cycle tour. Factor analysis is used to identify different types of cyclists, based on their green views: those with green money, those who prefer green products and the "re-cyclers". The results of the regression analysis reveal that socio-demographic variables and the right attitude towards the environment are significant predictors of stated willingness to pay for climate change mitigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	2222-3436			WOS:000385019400008		S	Musial, Izabela; Lyzwa, Wojciech; Wierzbowski, Michal			IEEE	Wierzbowski, Michal/A-2644-2019; Wierzbowski, Michal/S-4317-2019	Wierzbowski, Michal/0000-0002-9320-8761; Wierzbowski, Michal/0000-0002-9320-8761			Polish Energy Policy 2050 and its impact on energy mix and emissions								2016 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET (EEM)		International Conference on the European Energy Market													2016	2016	Energy Policy is a part of national or community policy that concerns the development of the energy sector.

It should also propose some mechanisms to achieve its objectives. The Energy Policies of Member States must be coherent with European Energy Policy.The paper presents assumptions of Polish Energy Policy 2050 (PEP2050) and its impact on the Polish energy mix, CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. Scenarios included in PEP 2050 have been evaluated using generation expansion planning model developed by the authors - eMix. The results of multiple scenarios implemented to the model were used in the process of development of Polish Energy Policy to 2050.

The underlying objectives are to increase the security of supply at affordable prices via market integration and to contribute to decarbonization by accommodating an increasing level of renewable generation. In this article we have assessed whether this target could effectively fulfil these two objectives. Our main focus is on the assessment of the impacts of compliance with the 10% interconnection target on the carbon emission of the European electricity system. Our main research question concerns the impact of interconnection capacity increases on EU carbon emission due to the better market integration, disregarding the RES-E integration aspects. In order to arrive at workable scenarios for the future cross-border capacity extension, the security of supply and market integration impacts are also assessed.We concluded on the basis of our European dispatch model that full compliance would slightly increase carbon emission in the EU, ceteris paribus. This impact is due to increased coal- and lignite-based electricity production, mainly in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. By increasing the interconnections of these countries with their neighbours at the present low carbon price under the EU emissions trading scheme, these carbon-intensive electricity systems run on higher utilization rates and consequently increase carbon emission. It has to be emphasized that the increase is found for the current situation, and changes in other factors, such as increases in carbon prices or renewable generation, could modify this result.Policy relevanceOur results demonstrate that EU network development and climate policies are highly interconnected. Changing patterns in the interconnections of the EU electricity systems connect diverse generation portfolios and in a low carbon price environment could increase carbon emission at the community level. Policy makers should be aware of the interactions between these areas and design policy tools that also consider negative synergies.

In this new epoch, the environmental stability is lost due to the human interference and the impact of economic development upon the environment. Such is an unprecedented change in human experience and needs to be mitigated in order to allow a safer human existence. Mitigation requires a lot more intense international cooperation than the one observed in the international regime on climate change. Alliances between key countries for the resolution of the decarbonization problem are crucial. They might be obtained if new interpretations of threat, security, and national interest are accepted along with a revision of the conception of sovereignty in which common global interests of the humanity are incorporated. What it is about is a complex change, but a change that will update important foundations of a geopolitics able to deal with the questions put forward by the 21st century.		No final do século XX e início do século XXI, uma nova época geológica teve início, o Antropoceno. Ele é caracterizado pela perda da estabilidade ambiental em razão da interferência humana, do impacto cumulativo do desenvolvimento econômico sobre o meio ambiente. A mudança é sem precedentes na experiência humana; mitigá-la significa assegurar uma existência mais segura para a humanidade. Essa mitigação, porém, requer concertação internacional muito mais densa do que a que tem sido observada no regime internacional sobre mudança do clima. A construção de alianças de descarbonização entre países-chave para a resolução do problema é crucial. Ela será possível mediante a revisão dos conceitos de ameaça, segurança e interesse nacional, e uma nova interpretação da soberania, em que interesses comuns da humanidade sejam incorporados ao fundamento vestfaliano. É uma mudança complexa, mas que atualizará fundamentos importantes para uma geopolítica capaz de lidar com questões do século XXI.	À la fin du XXème et au début du XXIème siècle, une nouvelle ère géologique a vu le jour: l’Anthropocène. Elle se caractérise par la perte de la stabilité environnementale en conséquence de l’interférence humaine, de l’impact cumulatif du développement économique sur l’environnement. Ce changement n’a pas de précèdent dans l’expérience humaine ; l’atténuer signifie assurer une existence plus rassurante pour l’humanité. Cette atténuation requiert, néanmoins, une concertation internationale beaucoup plus intense que celle que l’on peut observer à propos du régime international sur les changements climatiques. La construction d’alliances de décarbonisation entre des pays-clés s’avère cruciale pour la résolution du problème. Elle ne sera possible que par la révision des concepts de menace, de sécurité et d’intérêt national, et une nouvelle interprétation de la souveraineté, dans laquelle les intérêts communs de l’humanité soient incorporés au fondement westphalien. C’est un changement complexe, mais qui mettra à jour des bases importantes pour une géopolitique capable de faire face aux questions actuelles du XXIème siècle.						3	0	0	0	2	4	0	1	1806-9053			SCIELO:S0102-69092016000300501		J	김성배								Case Analysis on the Allocation of Greenhouse-Gas Emission Permits - 2015GUHAP55592 Decision -			배출권 할당처분에 관한 판례의 검토와 제언― 2015구합55592판결 ―					Environmental Law Review	환경법연구			38	1			23	56						2016	2016	Emission of greenhouse gases was prescribed on Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth BON, Which is both direct emission of greenhouse gases, which emits, discharges, or leaks greenhouse gases generated as a consequence of human activities, and indirect emission of greenhouse gases, which discharges greenhouse gases by using electricity or heat (limited to those from a heat source generated with a fuel or electricity) supplied by another person.

However, the Chinese public's willingness to pay (WTP) for climate change mitigation is, at best, under-researched. This study draws upon a large national survey of Chinese public cognition and attitude towards climate change and analyzes the determinants of consumers' WTP for energy-efficient and environment-friendly products. Eighty-five percent of respondents indicate that they are willing to pay at least 10 percent more than the market price for these products. The econometric analysis indicates that income, education, age and gender, as well as public awareness and concerns about climate change are significant factors influencing WTP. Respondents who are more knowledgeable and more concerned about the adverse effect of climate change show higher WTP. In comparison, income elasticity is small. The results are robust to different model specifications and estimation techniques.									1	0	0	0	0	1	0	10	0195-6574	1944-9089		WOS:000372855300009		J	Xu, Xiaofeng; Goswami, Santonu; Gulledge, Jay; Wullschleger, Stan D.; Thornton, Peter E.

Harnessing of renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels is widely regarded as a long-term mitigation strategy that requires the synthesis of knowledge from engineering, technology, and natural and social sciences. In this study, we examine how the adoption of interdisciplinary approaches has evolved over time and in different geographic regions. We conducted a comprehensive literature survey using an evaluation matrix of keywords, in combination with a word cloud analysis, to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of scholarly discourse about interdisciplinary approaches to climate change and renewable energy research and development (R&D). Publications that discuss interdisciplinary approaches to climate change and renewable energy have substantially increased over the last 60 years; it appears, however, that the nature, timing, and focus of these publications vary across countries and through time. Over the most recent three decades, the country-level contribution to interdisciplinary research for climate change has become more evenly distributed, but this was not true for renewable energy research, which remained dominated by the United Sates and a few other major economies. The research topics have also evolved: Water resource management was emphasized from 1990s to 2000s, policy and adaptation were emphasized from the 2000s to 2010-2013, while vulnerability became prominent during the most recent years (2010-2013). Our analysis indicates that the rate of growth of interdisciplinary research for renewable energy lags behind that for climate change, possibly because knowledge emanating from climate change science has motivated the subsequent upswing in renewable energy R&D.

Global environmental challenges, such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation, fall squarely into this category. This contribution focuses on the specific dimensions of evaluating the provision of global public goods in light of experiences from the Global Environment Facility. As global environmental problems persist, it is important that evaluations focus on the results and impact of our actions beyond the immediate outputs and outcomes of individual projects and programs. It is essential to be able to assess whether these actions are making a difference on the health of the global environment and in the lives of people depending on it. Multiple methods ranging from quantitative to qualitative, and innovations, such as the use of remote sensing and GIS, are needed and have been utilized by the GEF independent evaluation office. The contribution also discusses ways of making global environmental evaluations more influential amongst stakeholders.									8	0	0	1	0	8	0	13	1356-3890	1461-7153		WOS:000367846300008		J	Ekholm, Tommi				Ekholm, Tommi/B-6427-2015	Ekholm, Tommi/0000-0002-9124-6289			Optimal forest rotation age under efficient climate change mitigation								FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS				62				62	68		10.1016/j.forpol.2015.10.007				JAN 2016	2016	This paper considers the optimal rotation of forests when the carbon flows from forest growth and harvest are priced with an increasing price. Such evolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient climate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for enhanced carbon sequestration. For an infinitely long sequence of even-aged forest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due to the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore also involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and allow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of forest rotations.Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land, the initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length of the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters, the optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is released to the atmosphere upon harvest. In the near term, however, a higher growth rate of carbon price can lead to shorter rotations for forests that are already near their optimal rotation age, indicating that the effect of carbon price dynamics on optimal rotation is not entirely monotonous. The introduction of carbon pricing can also have a significant impact on bare land value, and in some considered parametrizations the land value was based solely on its potential to capture and store atmospheric carbon.

Missing from these debates are the public perspectives about eating less meat and consideration of cultural and social values associated with meat. The aim of this study was to explore public awareness of the environmental impact of food and their willingness to reduce meat consumption. Twelve focus groups and four individual interviews were conducted with adults from a range of socio-economic groups living in both rural and urban settings in Scotland. Public understanding of the link between food, environment and climate change was explored, with a focus on meat and attitudes towards reducing meat consumption. Data were transcribed and analysed thematically. Three dominant themes emerged: a lack of awareness of the association between meat consumption and climate change, perceptions of personal meat consumption playing a minimal role in the global context of climate change, and resistance to the idea of reducing personal meat consumption. People associated eating meat with pleasure, and described social, personal and cultural values around eating meat. Some people felt they did not need to eat less meat because they had already reduced their consumption or that they only ate small quantities. Scepticism of scientific evidence linking meat and climate change was common. Changing non-food related behaviours was viewed as more acceptable and a greater priority for climate change mitigation. The study highlights the role meat plays in the diet for many people, beyond nutritional needs. If healthy, sustainable dietary habits are to be achieved, cultural, social and personal values around eating meat must be integrated into the development of future dietary recommendations.

However, no such consideration has been given to how these carbon finance incentives' might be applied to mountain grasslands and shrublands, ecosystems that contain a substantial amount of carbon. These incentives amount to more than US$350 billion per annum and could potentially support underfunded natural resource management (NRM) activities, which are urgently needed to address numerous stressors impacting these important ecosystems. In the mountain context, NRM activities could include adaptive grazing management, sustainable cropping, ecosystem preservation, ecosystem restoration, and engineered soil conservation measures. This article investigates the stressors, challenges, and priorities related to the NRM of carbon stocks in mountain grasslands and shrublands; why carbon markets and climate finance have not yet been utilized in this context; and, what is required to position mountain-based NRM activities as eligible for carbon finance incentives. Using surveys and interviews triangulated with a systematic literature review, the study found that carbon finance incentives are not well understood, both amongst mountain-focused experts and in the literature. The study also found the required technical methodologies, policy frameworks, and data to be largely undeveloped. This article proposes a top-down conceptual policy framework that can be used to develop key enabling factors' with the view of extending the eligibility of carbon markets and climate finance to NRM activities undertaken in mountain grasslands and shrublands in the same way that has been afforded to other ecosystems.Policy relevanceThis is the first study to explicitly highlight the important role that the mountain grasslands and shrublands might play in international climate policy, and how carbon finance mechanisms might support better NRM in these areas. It is also the first to investigate why these incentives have not been adopted thus far. The article concludes by proposing a novel top-down carbon incentive enabling' framework that could be driven by governments and mountain development focused organizations so as to capture some of the opportunities offered by carbon-based incentives, and help meet international climate policy objectives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	2	16	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000381519200005		J	Bataille, Chris; Waisman, Henri; Colombier, Michel; Segafredo, Laura; Williams, Jim; Jotzo, Frank					Jotzo, Frank/0000-0002-2856-847X			The need for national deep decarbonization pathways for effective climate policy								CLIMATE POLICY				16		SI		S7	S26		10.1080/14693062.2016.1173005			1	2016	2016	Constraining global average temperatures to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels will probably require global energy system emissions to be halved by 2050 and complete decarbonization by 2100. In the nationally orientated climate policy framework codified under the Paris Agreement, each nation must decide the scale and method of their emissions reduction contribution while remaining consistent with the global carbon budget. This policy process will require engagement amongst a wide range of stakeholders who have very different visions for the physical implementation of deep decarbonization. The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project (DDPP) has developed a methodology, building on the energy, climate and economics literature, to structure these debates based on the following principles: country-scale analysis to capture specific physical, economic and political circumstances to maximize policy relevance, a long-term perspective to harmonize short-term decisions with the long-term objective and detailed sectoral analysis with transparent representation of emissions drivers through a common accounting framework or 'dashboard'. These principles are operationalized in the creation of deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs), which involve technically detailed, sector-by-sector maps of each country's decarbonization transition, backcasting feasible pathways from 2050 end points. This article shows how the sixteen DDPP country teams, covering 74% of global energy system emissions, used this method to collectively restrain emissions to a level consistent with the 2 degrees C target while maintaining development aspirations and reflecting national circumstances, mainly through efficiency, decarbonization of energy carriers (e.g. electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and synthetic gas) and switching to these carriers. The cross-cutting analysis of country scenarios reveals important enabling conditions for the transformation, pertaining to technology research and development, investment, trade and global and national policies.Policy relevanceIn the nation-focused global climate policy framework codified in the Paris Agreement, the purpose of the DDPP and DDPs is to provide a common method by which global and national governments, business, civil society and researchers in each country can communicate, compare and debate differing concrete visions for deep decarbonization in order to underpin the necessary societal and political consensus to design and implement short-term policy packages that are consistent with long-term global decarbonization.									27	0	0	1	0	27	2	7	1469-3062	1752-7457		WOS:000445036800002		J	Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa; Asumadu-Sarkodie, Samuel				Asumadu-Sarkodie, Samuel/I-3854-2015	Asumadu-Sarkodie, Samuel/0000-0001-5035-5983; Owusu, Phebe Asantewaa/0000-0001-7364-1640			A review of renewable energy sources, sustainability issues and climate change mitigation								COGENT ENGINEERING				3	1						10.1080/23311916.2016.1167990				2016	2016	The world is fast becoming a global village due to the increasing daily requirement of energy by all population across the world while the earth in its form cannot change. The need for energy and its related services to satisfy human social and economic development, welfare and health is increasing. Returning to renewables to help mitigate climate change is an excellent approach which needs to be sustainable in order to meet energy demand of future generations. The study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes: Energy Security, Energy Access, Social and Economic development, Climate Change Mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts. Despite these opportunities, there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation. These challenges include Market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and our daily carbon footprint. The study suggested some measures and policy recommendations which when considered would help achieve the goal of renewable energy thus to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and provide a clean environment as well as clean energy for all and future generations.									109	0	1	25	0	111	9	25	2331-1916			WOS:000397384100019		J	Salkeld, Deborah Fenney								Sustainable lifestyles for all?

Growing knowledge of the effects of climate change and particular impacts on disabled people have been highlighted by a number of authors, including a recent critique of disabled people's vulnerability' with respect to environmental hazard. This article focuses on the issue of citizen involvement with climate change mitigation - and more broadly individual and household-level efforts to reduce our impact on the environment. These more mundane aspects of climate change mitigation, for example through transitions to more sustainable lifestyles, also have significant implications for disabled people. The article argues that disability equality is a key component of sustainability. Limitations are demonstrated in policy designed to address these issues using the example of current UK policy, and it is suggested that policy approaches to sustainability should also be a concern of disability studies.									2	0	0	0	0	2	1	7	0968-7599	1360-0508		WOS:000378733600001		J	Markey, Raymond; McIvor, Joseph; Wright, Chris F.

Drawing upon a survey of 682 Australian employers and an analysis of 1329 enterprise agreements, we find strong associations between organisational activities for the reduction of carbon emissions and employee participation in motivating, developing and/or implementing these measures. Engagement with emissions reduction at the workplace level is more likely where employee participation has a substantive role involving deeper and wider influence in organisational decision-making. This is especially the case when a range of approaches, including collective bargaining through trade unions, are utilised. Reflecting extant research on employee participation, this study confirms the importance of the concepts of depth and scope in evaluating the extent to which employee participation is substantive, and that different forms of participation have mutually reinforcing impacts over workplace decisions to reduce carbon emissions. The findings presented suggest that the form of participation may be less important than the way in which it is implemented and the degree of substantive influence that employees have in practice.									11	0	0	0	0	11	1	14	0958-5192	1466-4399		WOS:000377531100006		J	Kelly, M.

Lessons from technology development for energy and sustainability								MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY				3						e3	10.1557/mre.2016.3				2016	2016	There are lessons from recent history of technology introductions which should not be forgotten when considering alternative energy technologies for carbon dioxide emission reductions.The growth of the ecological footprint of a human population about to increase from 7B now to 9B in 2050 raises serious concerns about how to live both more efficiently and with less permanent impacts on the finite world. One present focus is the future of our climate, where the level of concern has prompted actions across the world in mitigation of the emissions of CO2. An examination of successful and failed introductions of technology over the last 200 years generates several lessons that should be kept in mind as we proceed to 80% decarbonize the world economy by 2050. I will argue that all the actions taken together until now to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide will not achieve a serious reduction, and in some cases, they will actually make matters worse. In practice, the scale and the different specific engineering challenges of the decarbonization project are without precedent in human history. This means that any new technology introductions need to be able to meet the huge implied capabilities. An altogether more sophisticated public debate is urgently needed on appropriate actions that (i) considers the full range of threats to humanity, and (ii) weighs more carefully both the upsides and downsides of taking any action, and of not taking that action.									9	0	0	0	0	9	0	1	2329-2229	2329-2237		WOS:000443082500003		S	Cheng, Dongxiang; Zhao, Fanghua; Chen, Jing						Chao, Y; Zhang, WF; Li, X		A Review of the Research on the Measurement Methods of Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction for LNG Automotive Applications								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND PHARMACY (BEP 2016)		Advances in Biological Sciences Research		3				238	241						2016	2016	With the rapid development of economy in China, the demand of the society to the transportation industry is also increasing [ 1].

As a way to address climate change problems, in Europe, greenhouse gas emissions regulation and trading system, the tax adjustment etc. are being operated. These ways are access to address with policy. On the other hand, in the United States, Canada and Australia, the concept of CCS has been actively discussed to approach technical solution.By the 2014 worldwide, 55 large-scale integrated CCS projects are promoted. United States 19 cases, China 12 cases, European 8 cases, Canada 7 cases, Australian 3 cases ,the Middle East 2 cases, Asian 2 cases, South America 1 case and one case of Africa already are being actively conducted internationally. The 15 large-scale CCS projects now in operation globally, revealing a steady stream of projects demonstrating the technology in action around the world. The portfolio of operational large-scale CCS projects is expected to grow to 22 over the next 18 months or so, widening the range of countries, industries and technologies. This equates to a CO2 capture capacity of around 40 Mtpa. This portfolio of large-scale CCS projects is complemented by a cohort of notable pilot and demonstration projects across the world, some capturing and storing 100,000 tonnes or more of CO2 per year.Environmental laws related to the CCS have been studied worldwide. In the US, the president Barak Obama announced the Clean Power Plan of which gist is reduction of GHG emission by installation of CCS facilities at new power plants. The government of Republic of South africa has strived to institute CCS management guideline and legislation among the departments. Also Australian Government have almost reached the completion of secondary legislation which complement the 1st legislation enacted in 2008 for the Offshore geological storage. In the body below, the recent status of EU, ​​Canada, Japan and Norway was summarized.In terms of a lot of country all over the world have strived to study the technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Brazil 1992, the convention can be understood that implies a nature of technical agreement. If any countries can reduce the cost of technical realization beyond the securing of greenhouse gas reduction technologies through continuous technology development, it would leads the climate change era. So that, it is necessary to support actively for the technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially CCS. Above all, in order to establish the foundation of the CCS industry successfully, the regulations for safety of CCS technology should be enacted. Also, it is necessary for people to convert their consciousness about environment and CCS and to communicate between government and citizens.				산업화에 따른 이산화탄소 배출량의 2/3 이상이 화석연료를 사용하는 에너지 부분에서 발생하고 있는데, 이러한 상황은 지구 지표의 온도 상승, 해수면 상승 및 이상기후 발생과 같은 기상이변을 초래하고 있다. 이를 해결하기 위한 방안으로 CCS라는 개념이 도입되어 활발하게 논의되고 있다. CCS(Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage)란 산업 또는 에너지 관련 배출원으로부터 이산화탄소를 포집하여, 지하에 저장함으로써 장기간 대기로부터 격리시키는 기술을 의미한다. 본 연구에서는 기후변화 대응수단으로서의 CCS기술 개념을 살펴보고 이것이 어떻게 이산화탄소를 감축하는 데 기여하는지와 국제적으로 어디까지 연구가 진행되어 왔는지, 그리고 CCS기술을 실행하면서 법률적으로 어떤 문제가 발생할 수 있는지를 구체적으로 살펴보고자 한다. CCS기술을 활용하면 원유 또는 천연가스를 함유할 수 있는 다공질 암석과 같은 종류에 장기간 동안 CO2를 가두어 놓을 수 있다. 이와 관련하여 가장 핵심적으로 제기되는 문제는 예측불가능성이다. 지하에 주입된 이산화탄소가 지속적으로 지하에 봉인된 채로 존재할 것인지 아니면 수직상승하여 지면으로 누출되거나 그 밖의 예측 불가능한 형태로 이동할 것인지에 대한 우려를 완벽히 해결할 수 없다는 점이 핵심적인 문제로 거론된다. 따라서 CCS와 관련된 법률적 차원의 핵심쟁점은 CCS기술의 안전성 확보를 위한 규제와 연구는 물론이고 대중들의 기후변화에 대한 환경의식 전환, 일반시민들의 협조와 소통, 토지소유권자 또는 이해관계자에 대한 법적인 보상, 공익과 사익의 균형 등이라고 할 수 있다. 본 연구에서는 CCS개념과 CCS와 관련된 법적 쟁점을 파악한 후 그 쟁점에 대한 접근방법을 해외 사례(미국, 캐나다, 일본, 호주, 유럽 등)를 통해 살펴보고자 한다. 이산화탄소 포집과 저장에 대한 연구, 사전조사, 지역답사, 시행, 사후관리에 이르기까지 지역주민들의 반대정서에 어떻게 대응하는지 또는 어떻게 대중소통을 진행하고 있는지 연구하였다. 지역주민소통에 관한 사항은 특히 캐나다와 미국의 CCS실증 현장 답사를 통해 실무적인 인터뷰로 진행하였다. 또한 토지소유권과 관련하여 미국에서는 어떠한 법리로 분쟁을 해결했는지 몇 가지 판례를 이론적으로 분석하였다. CCS는 특성상 기술적 가능성만으로 시행 가능한 것이 아니고 지역주민과 소통을 하고 안정성을 가진 법제도를 확보함으로써 실현할 수 있는 복합적인 분야이다. 그래서 이 기술을 산업분야에 적용을 할 때 특히 NIMBY현상이 심한 우리나라의 주민정서 상 어떻게 대응을 할 것인지 해외사례가 시사하는 바를 고찰할 필요가 있다. 본 연구의 활용방안으로서는 CO2 지중저장 환경관리 법안을 입법하는데 기초자료로 활용될 수 있을 것이다. 나아가 안전성 확보, 지중저장 후 누출에 대한 모니터링 책임, 누출 시 분쟁해결 기준, 환경피해 보상기준 등을 논의하고 법안을 마련하는데 참고자료로 활용 가능할 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1975-0005			KJD:ART002077000		J	Lindstad, Haakon; Bright, Ryan M.; Stromman, Anders H.

The entire route lies in Arctic waters, which due to global warming, has become ice free during summer and autumn. The route goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean along the Russian Arctic coast and reduces voyage distance by 40% between Northern Europe and Japan. Traditionally, comparisons of the climate impact of transport solutions have been based on fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2), while other trace emissions in the exhaust gas have been ignored. It is becoming increasingly well-known however, that aerosols, and their precursors emitted from shipping are strong climate forcers, with a magnitude that is intimately connected to the specific region of emission. Taking into account these considerations, we apply region-specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) characterization factors to estimate the relative magnitude of the short-lived climate forcers in the Arctic compared to traditional shipping regions and to the impact of CO2 emissions in light of reduced overall fuel consumption. The results indicate that there are no general climate benefits of utilizing the Northern Sea Route, even with cleaner fuels, since the additional impact of emissions in the Arctic more than offsets the effect of shorter voyages. In terms of climate change mitigation, managing this trade-off will be challenging, as the Northern Sea Route offers cost savings per ton of freight transported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A better understanding of urban energy use, particularly in developing countries, can strengthen energy security, climate change mitigation and local pollution abatement. This study seeks to evaluate the trends in energy use and CO2 emissions in Bogota by determining energy flows through input and output analyses. The study establishes a relationship between energy and sustainable development by applying correlation analyses. Bogota consumes 24% of the electricity produced in the country, generates 96010.1 TJ of the gross energy, and emits CO2, NOx and CO (carbon monoxide). Correlation analyses indicate a strong and direct relationship between energy, economic variables and social variables, with the majority of the correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8. Strong positive correlations are particularly observed between energy consumption, the gross domestic product, the human development index and CO2 emissions. Energy per capita and CO2 emissions per capita also strongly correlate with the human development index and GINI coefficients. These results demonstrate that energy increasingly influences the development, economic growth and welfare of the city population. Thus, formulating strategies that will improve energy use in cities is important. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As NH3 and PM emissions partly originate from the same activities as greenhouse gases, interactions may exist between NH3 and PM emission abatement and greenhouse gas emissions. This study is aimed at estimating the costs and benefits of NH3 and PM emission abatement measures, considering interactions with agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. We combined an economic-ecological farm model for estimating emission reductions and abatement costs with an integrated environmental impact assessment model for estimating the benefits for human health and biodiversity, with applications to three Federal States in Germany. We reasoned that benefits exceed costs and that synergies with greenhouse gas reduction exist. All NH3 and PM emission abatement measures affected greenhouse gases. In crop production, conservation tillage increased farmers' gross margins and reduced both PM emissions and, via soil carbon sequestration, also greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits depended on the soil type and its carbon sequestration potential, which differ across regions. The substitution of urea fertiliser for calcium ammonium nitrate reduced both NH3 and greenhouse gas emissions. In livestock production, the measures with the highest net benefits were chemical washers for exhaust-air purification, injection or cultivator manure application and concrete manure storage cover. Low-protein pig feeding increased farmers' gross margins and also achieved high net benefits, with the benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction exceeding those of NH3 emission reduction. Low-protein poultry feeding and biofilters for air purification yielded negative net benefits and were therefore not recommended for implementation. The results confirm interactions of NH3 and PM emission abatement measures with greenhouse gas emissions and suggest that all relevant emission types be integrated in an analysis. Air pollution abatement and climate change mitigation have mainly been addressed in separate policies. Our results suggest that these policies are better integrated so as to stimulate synergies and to define the appropriate ambition level of emission reduction targets.

This compartmentalization is mirrored in scholarship, where much research has focused on the fragmentation of, respectively, global energy and global climate governance, but only little has been said about how these fields might be integrated. Our analysis of the International Energy Agency's (IEA) changing activities in recent years shows that governance integration - both within global energy governance and between global energy and climate governance - is now happening. The IEA has broadened its portfolio to embrace the full spectrum of energy issues, including renewable energy and climate change; it has built and is expanding key partnerships with both the UN climate convention and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); and it has become an authoritative advocate for the inter-related goals of a low-carbon transition and climate change mitigation. We show that these developments are not the result of a top-down plan, but have rather emerged through the Agency's various efforts to pursue its energy-centric mandate in a fast-changing global policy environment.

In spite of the knowledge of these consequences, transition from biomass to modern fuels has remained outside energy and development policies. In the present work, after describing the panorama of fuelwood use in the country and its importance as an energy source, an approach is presented for estimating CO2 savings achievable by transition to pressurized liquefied gas (LP). These savings can reach 3.14 Mt CO2e, 26% less than the baseline scenario. At the end we discuss on the transition to modern fuels in Mexico, the barriers that hinder it and the achievements and failures of the distribution of fuelwood saving cookstoves, as the only and most important governmental initiative to alleviate biomass use, comparing it with other priorities in the government's agenda.

In the UK, much of this impact is likely to arise by amplifying existing risks related to heat exposure, flooding, and chemical and biological contamination in buildings. Identifying the health effects of climate change on the indoor environment, and risks and opportunities related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, can help protect public health.We explored a range of health risks in the domestic indoor environment related to climate change, as well as the potential health benefits and unintended harmful effects of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies in the UK housing sector. We reviewed relevant scientific literature, focusing on housing-related health effects in the UK likely to arise through either direct or indirect mechanisms of climate change or mitigation and adaptation measures in the built environment. We considered the following categories of effect: (i)indoor temperatures, (ii) indoor air quality, (iii) indoor allergens and infections, and (iv) flood damage and water contamination. Climate change may exacerbate health risks and inequalities across these categories and in a variety of ways, if adequate adaptation measures are not taken. Certain changes to the indoor environment can affect indoor air quality or promote the growth and propagation of pathogenic organisms. Measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions have the potential for ancillary public health benefits including reductions in health burdens related heat and cold, indoor exposure to air pollution derived from outdoor sources, and mould growth. However, increasing airtightness of dwellings in pursuit of energy efficiency could also have negative effects by increasing concentrations of pollutants (such as PM2.5, CO and radon) derived from indoor or ground sources, and biological contamination. These effects can largely be ameliorated by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) and air filtration, where such solution is feasible and when the system is properly installed, operated and maintained. Groups at high risk of these adverse health effects include the elderly (especially those living on their own), individuals with pre-existing illnesses, people living in overcrowded accommodation, and the socio-economically deprived.A better understanding of how current and emerging building infrastructure design, construction, and materials may affect health in the context of climate change and mitigation and adaptation measures is needed in the UK and other high income countries. Long-term, energy efficient building design interventions, ensuring adequate ventilation, need to be promoted.

GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL				181	4			413	422		10.1111/geoj.12127				DEC 2015	2015	This commentary critically engages with the argument that climate change is the greatest threat to global health in the twenty-first century. A review of climate-health examples suggests that although it is important to be aware of the risk that climate change presents, health status is caused and mediated by multiple exposures. The current evidence suggests the impact of climate change over the next 30 years is not going to be catastrophic for health, and positioning it as the greatest threat - instead of other important factors such as poverty and health inequalities - could obscure the potential of current global health measures and reduce focus on other health risks such as non-communicable diseases and HIV/AIDS. Although climate change mitigation is vitally important to reduce far-future harm, the policymaking community should focus on current interventions that reduce populations' exposure to climate change, boost populations' ability to adapt, and reduce health inequalities.									7	0	0	2	1	7	1	39	0016-7398	1475-4959		WOS:000364648300010		J	Papathanasopoulou, Eleni; Beaumont, Nicola; Hooper, Tara; Nunes, Joana; Queiros, Ana M.

The marine environment will play a key role in hosting or supporting these new energy strategies. However, it is unclear how the construction, operation and eventual decommissioning of these energy systems, and their related infrastructure, will impact the marine environment, the ecosystem services (i.e. cultural, regulating, provisioning and supporting) and in turn the benefits it provides for human well-being. This uncertainty stems from a lack of research that has synthesised into a common currency the various effects of each energy sector on marine ecosystems and the benefits humans derive from it. To address this gap, the present study reviews existing ecosystem impact studies for offshore components of nuclear, offshore wind, offshore gas and offshore oil sectors and translates them into the common language of ecosystem service impacts that can be used to evaluate current policies. The results suggest that differences exist in the way in which energy systems impact ecosystem services, with the nuclear sector having a predominantly negative impact on cultural ecosystem services; oil and gas a predominately negative impact on cultural, provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services; while wind has a mix of impacts on cultural, provisioning and supporting services and an absence of studies for regulating services. This study suggests that information is still missing with regard to the full impact of these energy sectors on specific types of benefits that humans derive from the marine environment and proposes possible areas of targeted research.

However, scientific knowledge cannot become the basis of climate policy integration without agency input. Against this backdrop, this article analyses how the characterization of iLUCs alters as ENGOs mediate the knowledge of iLUC-associated research into European Union (EU) policy-making. After outlining the methodology of the frame analysis, I demonstrate how the different fields of scientific inquiry characterize iLUCs as contingent, uncertain and diverse. However, ENGOs re-frame this phenomenon as determined, certain and unified. ENGOs transform the complexity of iLUCs into a form that is compatible with the EU's modality of approaching biofuels as a question of the decarbonization of transport. Finally, there was an opportunity through appraising iLUCs to revisit the criticized governance of biofuels, but which was not grasped by the EU.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are categorized into two general types: attributional and consequential. The consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) method illustrates the change of flows to and from environment, resulting from different potential decisions. Depending on the analysis goal, CLCA is known to be the proper approach to address the environmental analysis of integrated biorefineries with multiple bioproducts.In this study, an LCA of hot water extraction-based biorefinery strategy was performed, including five production pathways. Defined process options consisted of an extraction of hemicellulose to produce (i) biogas, (ii) hemicellulose for animal feed, (iii) hemicellulose for C5-sugars, (iv) C5-sugars, and (v) furfural. Except for the "biogas", acetate salt was the by-product of all the process options. Consequential LCA results proved that the bark consumption, chemicals, and bioproducts transportation have significant environmental impacts. 'Hemicellulose for C5-sugars' and 'C5-sugars' outperformed other alternative options with a greenhouse gas reduction of 80% and 68%, respectively. Also, normalized results of these two options presented remarkable improvement of more than three times in human health impacts in comparison to existing process at the case study mill.

During the last century consumption of water and energy has been increased in the world. This trend is anticipated to continue in the decades to come. One of the greatest reasons is the unplanned industrial activities deteriorating environment in the name of rising standard of life. What is needed is the avoidance of environmental pollution and maintenance of natural balance, in the context of sustainable development. However, Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of the renewable energy resources. There is a large variation in annual precipitation, evaporation and surface run-off parameters, in Turkey. Precipitation is not evenly distributed in time and space throughout the country. There are 25 hydrological basins in Turkey. But the rivers often have irregular regimes. In this situation the main aim is to manage and use the water resources for renewable, sustainable and clean energy. This paper deals with water management for renewable, sustainable and clean energy in Turkey. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is perfect relationship between environment, ecology and sustainable development. If a proper balance is maintained among these three aspects then exergy for the welfare of human being is obtained. Efficient energy use which requires exergy analysis is a key solution to the environmental problems. A primary aim of minimizing the environmental impact is to increase the efficiency and decrease the related overall environmental impacts such as global warming, ozone depletion, and acid rain. This study has been written with a view to draw attention and to examine the range of views for integration of exergy for environment, ecology and sustainable development. Much of the information presented in this study is basically to acquire an understanding of exergy relations with environment, ecology and sustainable development.

We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010-2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy approaches in different locations, rather than adopting a universally rolled out strategy.

Essential requirements for energy efficiency are to produce less greenhouse gas emissions and to rely more on renewable energy sources for future sustainability. Policies for mitigation of the environment impact are having effects on both the supply and demand. While the former requires more alternate sources in smart grids and improved technologies for carbon capture and storage, the latter involves the reduction of energy wastes and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as prerequisites to green certification within the construction and building sector. Thus, access to sustainable, affordable, and secure energy is one of the major global strategic priorities to maintain and improve public health, sustain economic growth, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Toward this goal, many countries, including Australia, are investing in clean, efficient, reliable energy systems for a prosperous and environmentally sustainable future. Hence, exploring various options to ensure energy security by diversification of energy sources is an important step in meeting the future requirements and delivering clean energy to different industry sectors. This paper discusses options to manage the use of energy sources in the power generation and construction industries. Options for mitigation of environmental impact and for achievement of sustainable energy usage, such as building design with BIM, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
